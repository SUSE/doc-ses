 <title>About this guide</title>
 <para>
  Part of the &productname; family is the &rook; deployment tool, which runs on
  &caasp;. &rook; allows you to deploy and run &ceph; on top of &kube;, in
  order to provide container workloads with all their storage needs.
 </para>
 <para>
  Deployment using &rook; is currently in <emphasis>limited
  availability</emphasis>, meaning that it is only available to nominated and
  approved customers. For information on how to get so nominated, contact your
  SUSE sales team.

 <para>
  &rook; is a so-called storage operator: it automates many steps that you need
  to do manually in a "traditional" setup with &cephadm;. This guide explains
  how to install Rook after you installed &caasp;, and how to administer it.
