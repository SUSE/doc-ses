  &salt; along with &deepsea; is a <emphasis>stack</emphasis> of components

    <emphasis>&sminion;s</emphasis> are the nodes controlled by a dedicated

    A &smaster; runs its own &sminion;. It is required for running privileged
    tasks&mdash;for example creating, authorizing, and copying keys to
    minions&mdash;so that remote minions never need to run privileged tasks.

    <title>Sharing Multiple Roles per Server</title>
    <para>
     You will get the best performance from your &ceph; cluster when each role
     is deployed on a separate node. But real deployments sometimes require
     sharing one node for multiple roles. To avoid troubles with performance
     and upgrade procedure, do not deploy the &osd;, &mds;, or &mon; role to
     the &smaster;.

   <para>
    &sminion;s need to correctly resolve the &smaster;'s host name over the

  <title>Introduction to &deepsea;</title>

  <para>
   The goal of &deepsea; is to save the administrator time and confidently
   perform complex operations on a &ceph; cluster.
  </para>

  <para>
   &ceph; is a very configurable software solution. It increases both the
   freedom and responsibility of system administrators.
  </para>

  <para>
   The minimal &ceph; setup is good for demonstration purposes, but does not
   show interesting features of &ceph; that you can see with a big number of
   nodes.
  </para>

  <para>
   &deepsea; collects and stores data about individual servers, such as
   addresses and device names. For a distributed storage system such as &ceph;,
   there can be hundreds of such items to collect and store. Collecting the
   information and entering the data manually into a configuration management
   tool is exhausting and error prone.
  </para>

  <para>
   The steps necessary to prepare the servers, collect the configuration, and
   configure and deploy &ceph; are mostly the same. However, this does not
   address managing the separate functions. For day to day operations, the
   ability to trivially add hardware to a given function and remove it
   gracefully is a requirement.
  </para>

  <para>
   &deepsea; addresses these observations with the following strategy:
   &deepsea; consolidates the administrator's decisions in a single file. The
   decisions include cluster assignment, role assignment and profile
   assignment. And &deepsea; collects each set of tasks into a simple goal.
   Each goal is a <emphasis>stage</emphasis>:

  <sect2 xml:id="ds.minion.targeting">
   <title>Targeting the Minions</title>
   <para>
    &deepsea; commands are executed via the &salt; infrastructure. When using
    the <command>salt</command> command, you need to specify a set of
    &sminion;s that the command will affect. We describe the set of the minions
    as a <emphasis>target</emphasis> for the <command>salt</command> command.
    The following sections describe possible methods to target the minions.
   </para>
   <sect3 xml:id="ds.minion.targeting.name">
    <title>Matching the Minion Name</title>
    <para>
     You can target a minion or a group of minions by matching their names. A
     minion's name is usually the short host name of the node where the minion
     runs. This is a general &salt; targeting method, not related to &deepsea;.
     You can use globbing, regular expressions, or lists to limit the range of
     minion names. The general syntax follows:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt <replaceable>target</replaceable> example.module</screen>
    <tip>
     <title>&ceph;-only Cluster</title>
     <para>
      If all &sminion;s in your environment belong to your &ceph; cluster, you
      can safely substitute <replaceable>target</replaceable> with
      <literal>'*'</literal> to include <emphasis>all</emphasis> registered
      minions.
     </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
     Match all minions in the example.net domain (assuming the minion names are
     identical to their "full" host names):
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt '*.example.net' test.ping</screen>
    <para>
     Match the 'web1' to 'web5' minions:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt 'web[1-5]' test.ping</screen>
    <para>
     Match both 'web1-prod' and 'web1-devel' minions using a regular
     expression:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt -E 'web1-(prod|devel)' test.ping</screen>
    <para>
     Match a simple list of minions:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt -L 'web1,web2,web3' test.ping</screen>

   <sect3 xml:id="ds.minion.targeting.grain">
    <title>Targeting with a 'deepsea' Grain</title>
    <para>
     In a heterogeneous &salt;-managed environment where &productname;
     &productnumber; is deployed on a subset of nodes alongside other cluster
     solution(s), it is a good idea to 'mark' the relevant minions by applying
     a 'deepsea' grain to them. This way you can easily target &deepsea;
     minions in environments where matching by the minion name is problematic.
    </para>
    <para>
     To apply the 'deepsea' grain to a group of minions, run:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt <replaceable>target</replaceable> grains.append deepsea default</screen>
    <para>
     To remove the 'deepsea' grain from a group of minions, run:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt <replaceable>target</replaceable> grains.delval deepsea destructive=True</screen>
    <para>
     After applying the 'deepsea' grain to the relevant minions, you can target
     them as follows:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt -G 'deepsea:*' test.ping</screen>
    <para>
     The following command is an equivalent:

<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt -C 'G@deepsea:*' test.ping</screen>

    <title>Set the <option>deepsea_minions</option> Option</title>
    <para>
     Setting the <option>deepsea_minions</option> option's target is a

     minions during stages execution (refer to
     <xref linkend="deepsea.stage.description"/> for details.
    </para>

     In &ceph;, a single storage role would be insufficient to describe the
     many disk configurations available with the same hardware. &deepsea; stage
     1 will generate a default storage profile proposal. By default this
     proposal will be a <literal>bluestore</literal> profile and will try to
     propose the highest performing configuration for the given hardware setup.
     For example, external journals will be preferred over a single disk
     containing objects and metadata. Solid state storage will be prioritized
     over spinning disks. Profiles are assigned in the
     <filename>policy.cfg</filename> similar to roles.
    </para>

     The default proposal can be found in the profile-default directory tree.
