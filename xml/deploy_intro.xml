 <para>
  Since &productname; 7, &ceph; services are deployed as containers instead of
  RPM packages. The deployment process has two basic steps:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Deploying bootstrap cluster</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     This phase is called <emphasis>Day 1 deployment</emphasis> and consists of
     the following tasks: It includes installing the underlying operating
     system, configuring the &salt; infrastructure, and deploying the minimal
     cluster that consist of one MON and one MGR service.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Install and do basic configuration of the underlying operating
       system&mdash;&cephos;&mdash;on all cluster nodes.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Deploy the &salt; infrastructure on all cluster nodes for performing the
       initial deployment preparations via &cephsalt;.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Configure the basic properties of the cluster via &cephsalt; and deploy
       it.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Deploying additional services</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     During <emphasis>Day 2 deployment</emphasis>, additional core and non-core
     &ceph; services, for example gateways and monitoring stack, are deployed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>
 <important>
  <para>
   Note that the &ceph; community documentation uses the <command>cephadm
   bootstrap</command> command during initial deployment. &cephsalt; calls the
   <command>cephadm bootstrap</command> command automatically. The
   <command>cephadm bootstrap</command> command should not be run directly. Any
   &ceph; cluster deployment manually using the <command>cephadm
   bootstrap</command> will be unsupported.
  </para>
 </important>
 <important>
  <title>No support for dual stack</title>
  <para>
   &ceph; does not support dual stack&mdash;running &ceph; simultaneously on
   IPv4 and IPv6 is not possible. The validation process will reject a mismatch
   between <option>public_network</option> and <option>cluster_network</option>,
   or within either variable. The following example will fail the validation:

public_network: "192.168.10.0/24 fd00:10::/64"

  <title>Read the release notes</title>

  <para>
   In the release notes you can find additional information on changes since
   the previous release of &productname;. Check the release notes to see
   whether:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     your hardware needs special considerations.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     any used software packages have changed significantly.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     special precautions are necessary for your installation.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   The release notes also provide information that could not make it into the
   manual on time. They also contain notes about known issues.
  </para>

  <para>
   After having installed the package <package>release-notes-ses</package>,
   find the release notes locally in the directory
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/release-notes</filename> or online at
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/"/>.
