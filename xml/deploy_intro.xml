 <para>
  Since &productname; 7, &ceph; services are deployed as containers instead of
  RPM packages. The deployment process has two basic steps:

   <term>Deploying bootstrap cluster</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     This phase is called <emphasis>Day 1 deployment</emphasis> and consists of
     the following tasks: It includes installing the underlying operating
     system, configuring the &salt; infrastructure, and deploying the minimal
     cluster that consist of one MON and one MGR service.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Install and do basic configuration of the underlying operating
       system&mdash;&cephos;&mdash;on all cluster nodes.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Deploy the &salt; infrastructure on all cluster nodes for performing the
       initial deployment preparations via &cephsalt;.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Configure the basic properties of the cluster via &cephsalt; and deploy
       it.

  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Deploying additional services</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     During <emphasis>Day 2 deployment</emphasis>, additional core and non-core
     &ceph; services, for example gateways and monitoring stack, are deployed.
    </para>

  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>
 <important>
  <para>
   Note that the &ceph; community documentation uses the <command>cephadm
   bootstrap</command> command during initial deployment. &cephsalt; calls
   the <command>cephadm bootstrap</command> command automatically. The <command>cephadm bootstrap</command> command should not be run
   directly. Any &ceph; cluster deployment manually using the <command>cephadm
   bootstrap</command> will be unsupported.

   In the release notes you can find additional information on changes since
   the previous release of &productname;. Check the release notes to see

   The release notes also provide information that could not make it into the
   manual on time. They also contain notes about known issues.

   After having installed the package <package>release-notes-ses</package>,
   find the release notes locally in the directory
