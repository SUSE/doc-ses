 <para>
  &ganesha; provides an NFS access to either the &rgw; or the &cephfs;.
  It supports NFS versions 3, 4, 4.1 and 4.2. &ganesha; runs in the user
  instead of the kernel space and directly interacts with the &rgw; or
  &cephfs;.

   <title>General Information</title>
   <para>
    To successfully deploy &ganesha;, you need to add a
    <literal>role-ganesha</literal> to your
    <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/proposals/policy.cfg</filename>. For details,
    see <xref linkend="policy.configuration" />. &ganesha; also
    needs either a <literal>role-rgw</literal> or a <literal>role-mds</literal>
    present in the <filename>policy.cfg</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Although it is possible to install and run the &ganesha; server on an
    already existing &ceph; node, we recommend running it on a dedicated host
    with an access to the &ceph; cluster. The client hosts are typically not
    part of the cluster, but they need to have network access to the &ganesha;
    server.
   </para>
   <para>
    To enable the &ganesha; server after the initial installation,
    add the <literal>role-ganesha</literal>
    to the <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/proposals/policy.cfg</filename> on
    the &smaster; and re-run at least stages 2 and 4. For details,
    see <xref linkend="ceph.install.stack" />.
   </para>
   <para>
    &ganesha; is configured via the file <filename>/etc/ganesha/ganesha.conf</filename>
    that exists on the &ganesha; node. However, this file is overwritten each time
    &deepsea; stage 4 is executed. Therefore we recommend to edit the template
    used by &salt; which is the file
    <filename>/srv/salt/ceph/ganesha/files/ganesha.conf.j2</filename>
    on the &smaster;. For details about the configuration file, see
    <xref linkend="ceph.nfsganesha.config.general" />.

  <title>Example Installation</title>

   This procedure provides an example installation that uses both the
   &rgw; and &cephfs; File Abstraction Layers (FSAL) of &ganesha;.

    <para>
     If you have not done so, execute &deepsea; stages 0 and 1 before
     continuing with this procedure.

     After having executed stage 1 of &deepsea;, edit the

     Replace <replaceable>NODENAME</replaceable> with the name of a node
     in your cluster.

    <para>
     Also make sure, that each <literal>role-mds</literal> and <literal>role-mds</literal>
     are assigned to at least one node.

    <para>
     Create the file <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/rgw.sls</filename> and insert
     the following content:

    <screen>rgw_configurations:
  rgw:
    users:
      - { uid: "demo", name: "Demo", email: "demo@demo.nil" }
      - { uid: "demo1", name: "Demo1", email: "demo1@demo.nil" }</screen>
    <para>
     These users are later created as &rgw; users and API keys are generated.
     On the &rgw; node, you can later run <command>radosgw-admin user ls</command> to
     list all created users and <command>radosgw-admin user info --uid=demo</command>
     to obtain details about single users.
