  &ganesha; provides an NFS access to either the &rgw; or the &cephfs;.
  It supports NFS versions 3, 4, 4.1 and 4.2. &ganesha; runs in the user
  instead of the kernel space and directly interacts with the &rgw; or
  &cephfs;.

   <para>
    To successfully deploy &ganesha;, you need to add a
    <literal>role-ganesha</literal> to your
    <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/proposals/policy.cfg</filename>. For details,
    see <xref linkend="policy.configuration" />. &ganesha; also
    needs either a <literal>role-rgw</literal> or a <literal>role-mds</literal>
    present in the <filename>policy.cfg</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Although it is possible to install and run the &ganesha; server on an
    already existing &ceph; node, we recommend running it on a dedicated host
    with access to the &ceph; cluster. The client hosts are typically not
    part of the cluster, but they need to have network access to the &ganesha;
    server.
   </para>
   <para>
    To enable the &ganesha; server at any point after the initial installation,
    add the <literal>role-ganesha</literal> to the <filename>policy.cfg</filename>
    and re-run at least &deepsea; stages 2 and 4. For details,
    see <xref linkend="ceph.install.stack" />.
   </para>
   <para>
    &ganesha; is configured via the file <filename>/etc/ganesha/ganesha.conf</filename>
    that exists on the &ganesha; node. However, this file is overwritten each time
    &deepsea; stage 4 is executed. Therefore we recommend to edit the template
    used by &salt; which is the file
    <filename>/srv/salt/ceph/ganesha/files/ganesha.conf.j2</filename>
    on the &smaster;. For details about the configuration file, see
    <xref linkend="ceph.nfsganesha.config" />.

  <title>Example Installation</title>
  <para>
   This procedure provides an example installation that uses both the
   &rgw; and &cephfs; File System Abstraction Layers (FSAL) of &ganesha;.
  </para>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     If you have not done so, execute &deepsea; stages 0 and 1 before
     continuing with this procedure.
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.smaster;salt-run state.orch ceph.stage.0
&prompt.smaster;salt-run state.orch ceph.stage.1</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     After having executed stage 1 of &deepsea;, edit the
     <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/proposals/policy.cfg</filename> and add
     the line
    </para>
    <screen>role-ganesha/cluster/<replaceable>NODENAME</replaceable></screen>
    <para>
     Replace <replaceable>NODENAME</replaceable> with the name of a node
     in your cluster.
    </para>
    <para>
     Also make sure, that a <literal>role-mds</literal> and a <literal>role-mds</literal>
     is assigned.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Create the file <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/rgw.sls</filename> and insert
     the following content:
    </para>
    <screen>rgw_configurations:
  rgw:
    users:
      - { uid: "demo", name: "Demo", email: "demo@demo.nil" }
      - { uid: "demo1", name: "Demo1", email: "demo1@demo.nil" }</screen>
    <para>
     These users are later created as &rgw; users and API keys are generated.
     On the &rgw; node, you can later run <command>radosgw-admin user ls</command> to
     list all created users and <command>radosgw-admin user info --uid=demo</command>
     to obtain details about single users.
    </para>
    <para>
     &deepsea; makes sure that &rgw; and &ganesha; both receive the
     credentials of all users listed in the <literal>rgw</literal>
     section of the <filename>rgw.sls</filename>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Execute at least stages 2 and 4 of &deepsea;. Running stage 3
     in between is recommended.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Verify that &ganesha; is working by mounting the NFS share from a client
     node:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.root;<command>mount</command> -t nfs <replaceable>GANESHA_NODE_IP</replaceable>:/ /mnt
&prompt.root;<command>ls</command> /mnt
cephfs  demo  demo1</screen>
    <para>
     <filename>/mnt</filename> should contain all exported paths. Folders
     for &cephfs; and both &rgw; users should exist.
    </para>
