  <title>Identifying Orphaned Partitions</title>

  <para>
   To identify possibly orphaned journal/WAL/DB devices, follow these steps:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Pick the device that may have orphaned partitions and save the list of its
     partitions to a file:
    </para>
<screen>
&prompt.sminion;ls /dev/sdd?* &gt; /tmp/partitions
</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Run <command>readlink</command> against all block.wal, block.db, and
     journal devices, and compare the output to the previously saved list of
     partitions:
    </para>
<screen>
&prompt.sminion;readlink -f /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-*/{block.wal,block.db,journal} \
 | sort | comm -23 /tmp/partitions -
</screen>
    <para>
     The output is the list of partitions that are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
     used by &ceph;.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Remove the orphaned partitions that do not belong to &ceph; with your
     preferred command (for example <command>fdisk</command>,
     <command>parted</command>, or <command>sgdisk</command>).

 <sect1 xml:id="tips.scrubbing">
  <title>Adjusting Scrubbing</title>

  <para>
   By default, &ceph; performs light scrubbing (find more details in
   <xref linkend="scrubbing"/>) daily and deep scrubbing weekly.
   <emphasis>Light</emphasis> scrubbing checks object sizes and checksums to
   ensure that placement groups are storing the same object data.
   <emphasis>Deep</emphasis> scrubbing checks an object’s content with that
   of its replicas to ensure that the actual contents are the same. The price
   for checking data integrity is increased I/O load on the cluster during the
   scrubbing procedure.
  </para>

  <para>
   The default settings allow &osd;s to initiate scrubbing at inappropriate
   times, such as during periods of heavy loads. Customers may experience
   latency and poor performance when scrubbing operations conflict with their
   operations. &ceph; provides several scrubbing settings that can limit
   scrubbing to periods with lower loads or during off-peak hours.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the cluster experiences high loads during the day and low loads late at
   night, consider restricting scrubbing to night time hours, such as 11pm till
   6am:
  </para>

<screen>
[osd]
osd_scrub_begin_hour = 23
osd_scrub_end_hour = 6
</screen>

  <para>
   If time restriction is not an effective method of determining a scrubbing
   schedule, consider using the <option>osd_scrub_load_threshold</option>
   option. The default value is 0.5, but it could be modified for low load
   conditions:
  </para>

<screen>
[osd]
osd_scrub_load_threshold = 0.25

  <title>Stopping OSDs without Rebalancing</title>

  <para>
   You may need to stop OSDs for maintenance periodically. If you do not want
   CRUSH to automatically rebalance the cluster in order to avoid huge data
   transfers, set the cluster to <literal>noout</literal> first:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.sminion;ceph osd set noout
</screen>

  <para>
   When the cluster is set to <literal>noout</literal>, you can begin stopping
   the OSDs within the failure domain that requires maintenance work:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.sminion;systemctl stop ceph-osd@<replaceable>OSD_NUMBER</replaceable>.service
</screen>

  <para>
   Find more information in
   <xref linkend="ceph.operating.services.individual"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   After you complete the maintenance, start OSDs again:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.sminion;systemctl start ceph-osd@<replaceable>OSD_NUMBER</replaceable>.service
</screen>

  <para>
   After OSD services are started, unset the cluster from
   <literal>noout</literal>:

  <title>Time Synchronization of Nodes</title>

  <para>
   &ceph; requires precise time synchronization between all nodes.
  </para>

  <para>
   We recommend synchronizing all &ceph; cluster nodes with at least three
   reliable time sources that are located on the internal network. The internal
   time sources can point to a public time server or have their own time
   source.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Public Time Servers</title>
   <para>
    Do not synchronize all &ceph; cluster nodes directly with remote public
    time servers. With such a configuration, each node in the cluster has its
    own NTP daemon that communicates continually over the Internet with a set
    of three or four time servers that may provide slightly different time.
    This solution introduces a large degree of latency variability that makes
    it difficult or impossible to keep the clock drift under 0.05 seconds which
    is what the &ceph; monitors require.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   For details how to set up the NTP server refer to
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_sle_admin/data/cha_ntp.html">&sls;
   Administration Guide</link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Then to change the time on your cluster, do the following:

  <important>
   <title>Setting Time</title>
   <para>
    You may face a situation when you need to set the time back, for example if
    the time changes from the summer to the standard time. We do not recommend
    to move the time backward for a longer period than the cluster is down.
    Moving the time forward does not cause any trouble.

 <sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.cluster_mntc.unbalanced">
  <title>Checking for Unbalanced Data Writing</title>

  <para>
   When data is written to OSDs evenly, the cluster is considered balanced.
   Each OSD within a cluster is assigned its <emphasis>weight</emphasis>. The
   weight is a relative number and tells &ceph; how much of the data should be
   written to the related OSD. The higher the weight, the more data will be
   written. If an OSD has zero weight, no data will be written to it. If the
   weight of an OSD is relatively high compared to other OSDs, a large portion
   of the data will be written there, which makes the cluster unbalanced.
  </para>

  <para>
   Unbalanced clusters have poor performance, and in the case that an OSD with
   a high weight suddenly crashes, a lot of data needs to be moved to other
   OSDs, which slows down the cluster as well.
  </para>

  <para>
   To avoid this, you should regularly check OSDs for the amount of data
   writing. If the amount is between 30% and 50% of the capacity of a group of
   OSDs specified by a given ruleset, you need to reweight the OSDs. Check for
   individual disks and find out which of them fill up faster than the others
   (or are generally slower), and lower their weight. The same is valid for
   OSDs where not enough data is written&mdash;you can increase their weight to
   have &ceph; write more data to them. In the following example, you will find
   out the weight of an OSD with ID 13, and reweight it from 3 to 3.05:
  </para>

<screen>$ ceph osd tree | grep osd.13
 13  3                   osd.13  up  1

 $ ceph osd crush reweight osd.13 3.05
 reweighted item id 13 name 'osd.13' to 3.05 in crush map

 $ ceph osd tree | grep osd.13
 13  3.05                osd.13  up  1</screen>

  <para/>

  <tip>
   <title>OSD Reweight by Utilization</title>
   <para>
    The <command>ceph osd reweight-by-utilization</command>
    <replaceable>threshold</replaceable> command automates the process of
    reducing the weight of OSDs which are heavily overused. By default it will
    adjust the weights downward on OSDs which reached 120% of the average
    usage, but if you include threshold it will use that percentage instead.
   </para>
  </tip>

 <sect1 xml:id="storage.tips.ceph_btrfs_subvol">
  <title>Btrfs Subvolume for <filename>/var/lib/ceph</filename> on &mon; Nodes</title>

  <para>
   &sle; is by default installed on a Btrfs partition. &mon;s store their state
   and database in the <filename>/var/lib/ceph</filename> directory. To prevent
   corruption of a &mon; from a system rollback of a previous snapshot, create
   a Btrfs subvolume for <filename>/var/lib/ceph</filename>. A dedicated
   subvolume excludes the monitor data from snapshots of the root subvolume.
  </para>

  <para>
   Therefore it is necessary to create a Btrfs subvolume for
   <filename>/var/lib/ceph</filename> and exclude it from snapshots and
   rollbacks. You need to create the subvolume before running &deepsea; stage.0
   because stage.0 installs &ceph; related packages and creates the
   <filename>/var/lib/ceph</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <para>
   &deepsea; stage.3 then verifies whether <filename>@/var/lib/ceph</filename>
   is a Btrfs subvolume and fails if it is a normal directory.

  <title>How to Locate Physical Disks using LED Lights</title>

  <para>
   This section describes using <systemitem>libstoragemgmt</systemitem> and/or
   third party tools to adjust the LED lights on physical disks. This
   capability may not be available for all hardware platforms.
  </para>

  <para>
   Matching an OSD disk to a physical disk can be challenging, especially on
   nodes with a high density of disks. Some hardware environments include LED
   lights than can be adjusted via software to flash or illuminate a different
   color for identification purposes. &productname; offers support for this
   capability through &salt;, <systemitem>libstoragemgmt</systemitem> and third
   party tools specific to the hardware in use. The configuration for this
   capability is defined in the
   <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/disk_led.sls</filename> &spillar;:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root; cat /srv/pillar/ceph/disk_led.sls
# This is the default configuration for the storage enclosure LED blinking.
# The placeholder {device_file} will be replaced with the device file of
# the disk when the command is executed.
#
# Have a look into the /srv/pillar/ceph/README file to find out how to
# customize this configuration per minion/host.

disk_led:
  cmd:
    ident:
      'on': lsmcli local-disk-ident-led-on --path '{device_file}'
      'off': lsmcli local-disk-ident-led-off --path '{device_file}'
    fault:
      'on': lsmcli local-disk-fault-led-on --path '{device_file}'
      'off': lsmcli local-disk-fault-led-off --path '{device_file}'</screen>

  <para>
   The default configuration for <filename>disk_led.sls</filename> offers disk
   LED support through the <systemitem>libstoragemgmt</systemitem> layer.
   However, <systemitem>libstoragemgmt</systemitem> provides this support
   through a hardware-specific plugin and third party tools. Unless both the
   <systemitem>libstoragemgmt</systemitem> plugin and the third party tools
   appropriate for the hardware are installed,
   <systemitem>libstoragemgmt</systemitem> will not be able to adjust the LEDs.
  </para>

  <para>
   With or without <systemitem>libstoragemgmt</systemitem>, third party tools
   may be required to adjust LED lights. These third party tools are available
   through various hardware vendors. Some of the common vendors and tools are:

  <para>
   &sls; also provides the <package>ledmon</package> package, and
   <command>ledctl</command> tool. This tool may also work for hardware
   environments utilizing Intel storage enclosures. Proper syntax when using
   this tool is as follows:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root; cat /srv/pillar/ceph/disk_led.sls
disk_led:
  cmd:
    ident:
      'on': ledctl locate='{device_file}'
      'off': ledctl locate_off='{device_file}'
    fault:
      'on': ledctl locate='{device_file}'
      'off': ledctl locate_off='{device_file}'</screen>

  <para>
   If you are on supported hardware, with all required third party tools, LEDs
   can be enabled or disabled using the following command syntax from the
   &smaster; node:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.root;salt-run disk_led.device <replaceable>NODE</replaceable> <replaceable>DISK</replaceable> <replaceable>fault|ident</replaceable> <replaceable>on|off</replaceable>
</screen>

  <para>
   For example, to enable or disable LED identification or fault lights on
   <filename>/dev/sdd</filename> on OSD node <filename>srv16.ceph</filename>,
   run the following:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;salt-run disk_led.device srv16.ceph sdd ident on
&prompt.root;salt-run disk_led.device srv16.ceph sdd ident off
&prompt.root;salt-run disk_led.device srv16.ceph sdd fault on
&prompt.root;salt-run disk_led.device srv16.ceph sdd fault off</screen>

  <note>
   <title>Device naming</title>
   <para>
    The device name used in the <command>salt-run</command> command needs to
    match the name recognized by salt. The following command can be used to
    display these names:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt '<replaceable>minion_name</replaceable>' grains.get disks
</screen>
  </note>

  <para>
   In many environments, the <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/disk_led.sls</filename>
   configuration will require changes in order to adjust the LED lights for
   specific hardware needs. Simple changes may be performed through replacing
   <command>lsmcli</command> with another tool, or adjusting command line
   parameters. Complex changes may be accomplished through calling an external
   script in place of the <filename>lsmcli</filename> command. When making any
   changes to <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/disk_led.sls</filename>, follow these
   steps:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Make required changes to
     <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/disk_led.sls</filename> on the &smaster; node.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Verify that the changes are reflected correctly in the pillar data:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;salt '<replaceable>SALT MASTER</replaceable>*' pillar.get disk_led</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Refresh the pillar data on all nodes using:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;salt '*' saltutil.pillar_refresh</screen>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   It is possible to use an external script to directly use third-party tools
   to adjust LED lights. The following examples show how to adjust
   <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/disk_led.sls</filename> to support an external
   script, and two sample scripts for HP and LSI environments.
