  <title>Identifying Orphaned Volumes</title>

  <para>
   To identify possibly orphaned journal/WAL/DB volumes, follow these steps:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
        Get a list of OSD IDs for which LVs exist, but not OSD daemon is running on the node.
    </para>
<screen>
&prompt.sminion; comm -3 &lt;(ceph osd tree | grep up | awk '{print $4}') &lt;(cephadm ceph-volume lvm list 2&gt;/dev/null | grep ====== | awk '{print $2}')
</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
      If the command outputs one or more OSDs (for example osd.33), take
      the IDs (33 in the prior example) and zap the associated volumes.
    </para>
    <screen>
&prompt.sminion; ceph-volume lvm zap --destroy --osd-id <replaceable>ID</replaceable>.
    </screen>
   </step>
  </procedure>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="tips-scrubbing">
  <title>Adjusting Scrubbing</title>

  <para>
   By default, &ceph; performs light scrubbing daily (find more details in
   <xref linkend="scrubbing"/>) and deep scrubbing weekly.
   <emphasis>Light</emphasis> scrubbing checks object sizes and checksums to
   ensure that placement groups are storing the same object data.
   <emphasis>Deep</emphasis> scrubbing checks an object’s content with that
   of its replicas to ensure that the actual contents are the same. The price
   for checking data integrity is increased I/O load on the cluster during the
   scrubbing procedure.
  </para>

  <para>
   The default settings allow &osd;s to initiate scrubbing at inappropriate
   times, such as during periods of heavy loads. Customers may experience
   latency and poor performance when scrubbing operations conflict with their
   operations. &ceph; provides several scrubbing settings that can limit
   scrubbing to periods with lower loads or during off-peak hours.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the cluster experiences high loads during the day and low loads late at
   night, consider restricting scrubbing to night time hours, such as 11pm till
   6am:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.cephuser;ceph config set osd osd_scrub_begin_hour 23
&prompt.cephuser;ceph config set osd osd_scrub_end_hour 6
</screen>

  <para>
   If time restriction is not an effective method of determining a scrubbing
   schedule, consider using the <option>osd_scrub_load_threshold</option>
   option. The default value is 0.5, but it could be modified for low load
   conditions:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph config set osd osd_scrub_load_threshold 0.25</screen>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="tips-stopping-osd-without-rebalancing">
  <title>Stopping OSDs without Rebalancing</title>

  <para>
   You may need to stop OSDs for maintenance periodically. If you do not want
   CRUSH to automatically rebalance the cluster in order to avoid huge data
   transfers, set the cluster to <literal>noout</literal> first:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.sminion;ceph osd set noout
</screen>

  <para>
   When the cluster is set to <literal>noout</literal>, you can begin stopping
   the OSDs within the failure domain that requires maintenance work. To
   identify the unique FSID of the cluster, run <command>ceph fsid</command>.
   To identify the &ogw; daemon name, run
  </para>

<screen>ceph orch ps ---hostname <replaceable>HOSTNAME</replaceable></screen>

<screen>systemctl stop ceph-<replaceable>FSID</replaceable>@<replaceable>DAEMON_NAME</replaceable></screen>

  <para>
   Find more information about operating &ceph; services and identifying their
   names in <xref linkend="cha-ceph-operating"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   After you complete the maintenance, start OSDs again:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.sminion;systemctl start ceph-<replaceable>FSID</replaceable>@osd.<replaceable>SERVICE_ID</replaceable>.service</screen>

  <para>
   After OSD services are started, unset the cluster from
   <literal>noout</literal>:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph osd unset noout</screen>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 xml:id="storage-bp-cluster-mntc-unbalanced">
  <title>Checking for Unbalanced Data Writing</title>

  <para>
   When data is written to OSDs evenly, the cluster is considered balanced.
   Each OSD within a cluster is assigned its <emphasis>weight</emphasis>. The
   weight is a relative number and tells &ceph; how much of the data should be
   written to the related OSD. The higher the weight, the more data will be
   written. If an OSD has zero weight, no data will be written to it. If the
   weight of an OSD is relatively high compared to other OSDs, a large portion
   of the data will be written there, which makes the cluster unbalanced.
  </para>

  <para>
   Unbalanced clusters have poor performance, and in the case that an OSD with
   a high weight suddenly crashes, a lot of data needs to be moved to other
   OSDs, which slows down the cluster as well.
  </para>

  <para>
   To avoid this, you should regularly check OSDs for the amount of data
   writing. If the amount is between 30% and 50% of the capacity of a group of
   OSDs specified by a given ruleset, you need to reweight the OSDs. Check for
   individual disks and find out which of them fill up faster than the others
   (or are generally slower), and lower their weight. The same is valid for
   OSDs where not enough data is written&mdash;you can increase their weight to
   have &ceph; write more data to them. In the following example, you will find
   out the weight of an OSD with ID 13, and reweight it from 3 to 3.05:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.cephuser;ceph osd tree | grep osd.13
 13  hdd 3                osd.13  up  1.00000  1.00000

 &prompt.cephuser;ceph osd crush reweight osd.13 3.05
 reweighted item id 13 name 'osd.13' to 3.05 in crush map

&prompt.cephuser;ceph osd tree | grep osd.13
 13  hdd 3.05                osd.13  up  1.00000  1.00000
</screen>

  <para/>

  <tip>
   <title>OSD Reweight by Utilization</title>
   <para>
    The <command>ceph osd reweight-by-utilization</command>
    <replaceable>threshold</replaceable> command automates the process of
    reducing the weight of OSDs which are heavily overused. By default it will
    adjust the weights downward on OSDs which reached 120% of the average
    usage, but if you include threshold it will use that percentage instead.
   </para>

  <title>Increasing File Descriptors</title>

  <para>
   For OSD daemons, the read/write operations are critical to keep the &ceph;
   cluster balanced. They often need to have many files open for reading and
   writing at the same time. On the OS level, the maximum number of
   simultaneously open files is called 'maximum number of file descriptors'.
  </para>

  <para>
   To prevent OSDs from running out of file descriptors, you can override the
   default and specify an appropriate value, for example:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph config set global max_open_files 131072</screen>

  <para>
   After you change <option>max_open_files</option>, you need to restart the
   OSD service on the relevant &ceph; node.

  <title>Integration with Virtualization Software</title>

  <sect2 xml:id="storage-bp-integration-kvm">
   <title>Storing &kvm; Disks in &ceph; Cluster</title>
   <para>
    You can create a disk image for a &kvm;-driven virtual machine, store it in
    a &ceph; pool, optionally convert the content of an existing image to it,
    and then run the virtual machine with <command>qemu-kvm</command> making
    use of the disk image stored in the cluster. For more detailed information,
    see
    <xref linkend="cha-ceph-kvm"/>.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="storage-bp-integration-libvirt">
   <title>Storing &libvirt; Disks in &ceph; Cluster</title>
   <para>
    Similar to &kvm; (see <xref linkend="storage-bp-integration-kvm"/>), you
    can use &ceph; to store virtual machines driven by &libvirt;. The advantage
    is that you can run any &libvirt;-supported virtualization solution, such
    as &kvm;, &xen;, or LXC. For more information, see
    <xref linkend="cha-ceph-libvirt"/>.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="storage-bp-integration-xen">
   <title>Storing &xen; Disks in &ceph; Cluster</title>
   <para>
    One way to use &ceph; for storing &xen; disks is to make use of &libvirt;
    as described in <xref linkend="cha-ceph-libvirt"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Another option is to make &xen; talk to the <systemitem>rbd</systemitem>
    block device driver directly:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      If you have no disk image prepared for &xen;, create a new one:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;rbd create myimage --size 8000 --pool mypool</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      List images in the pool <literal>mypool</literal> and check if your new
      image is there:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;rbd list mypool</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Create a new block device by mapping the <literal>myimage</literal> image
      to the <systemitem>rbd</systemitem> kernel module:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;rbd map --pool mypool myimage</screen>
     <tip>
      <title>User Name and Authentication</title>
      <para>
       To specify a user name, use <option>--id
       <replaceable>user-name</replaceable></option>. Moreover, if you use
       <systemitem>cephx</systemitem> authentication, you must also specify a
       secret. It may come from a keyring or a file containing the secret:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;rbd map --pool rbd myimage --id admin --keyring /path/to/keyring</screen>
      <para>
       or
      </para>
<screen>&cephuser;rbd map --pool rbd myimage --id admin --keyfile /path/to/file</screen>
     </tip>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      List all mapped devices:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;<command>rbd showmapped</command>
 id pool   image   snap device
 0  mypool myimage -    /dev/rbd0</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Now you can configure &xen; to use this device as a disk for running a
      virtual machine. You can for example add the following line to the
      <command>xl</command>-style domain configuration file:
     </para>
<screen>disk = [ '/dev/rbd0,,sda', '/dev/cdrom,,sdc,cdrom' ]</screen>

  <para>
   As a general rule, time synchronization must be configured and running on
   all nodes. Once time synchronization is set up, the clocks should not get
   skewed. However, if a clock skew is to occur, this is likely due to the

   <systemitem class="daemon">chronyd.service</systemitem> not running on one
   or more hosts.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    It is also possible that the battery on the motherboard has died, and the
    clock skew will be more pronounced. If this is the case, be aware that it
    will take quite some time for <systemitem class="daemon">chronyd</systemitem> to re-synchronize
    the clocks.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   If you receive a clock skew warning, confirm that the
   <systemitem class="daemon">chronyd.service</systemitem> daemon is running on all
   cluster nodes. If not, restart the service and wait for chronyd to re-sync
   the clock.

  <title>Poor Cluster Performance Caused by Network Problems</title>

  <para>
   There may be other reasons why cluster performance becomes weak, such as
   network problems. In such case, you may notice the cluster reaching quorum,
   OSD and monitor nodes going offline, data transfers taking a long time, or a
   lot of reconnect attempts.
  </para>

  <para>
   To check whether cluster performance is degraded by network problems,
   inspect the &ceph; log files under the <filename>/var/log/ceph</filename>
   directory.
  </para>

  <para>
   To fix network issues on the cluster, focus on the following points:

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Basic network diagnostics. Try running the <literal>net.ping</literal>
     diagnostics tool. This tool has cluster nodes send network pings from
     their network interfaces to the network interfaces of other cluster nodes,
     and measures the average response time. Any specific response time much
     slower then average will also be reported. See
     <xref linkend="network-test-basic-diagnostics"/> for more information.
    </para>

    <para>
     Check firewall settings on cluster nodes. Make sure they do not block
     ports or protocols required by &ceph; operation. See <xref

     settings.

   <title>Separate Network</title>
   <para>
    To ensure fast and safe network communication between cluster nodes, set up
    a separate network used exclusively by the cluster OSD and monitor nodes.

 <sect1 xml:id="trouble-jobcache">
  <title><filename>/var</filename> Running Out of Space</title>

  <para>
   By default, the &smaster; saves every minion's result for every job in its
   <emphasis>job cache</emphasis>. The cache can then be used later to look up
   results from previous jobs. The cache directory defaults to
   <filename>/var/cache/salt/master/jobs/</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Each job return from every minion is saved in a single file. Over time this
   directory can grow very large, depending on the number of published jobs and
   the value of the <option>keep_jobs</option> option in the
   <filename>/etc/salt/master</filename> file. <option>keep_jobs</option> sets
   the number of hours (24 by default) to keep information about past minion
   jobs.
  </para>

<screen>keep_jobs: 24</screen>

  <important>
   <title>Do Not Set <option>keep_jobs: 0</option></title>
   <para>
    Setting <option>keep_jobs</option> to '0' will cause the job cache cleaner
    to <emphasis>never</emphasis> run, possibly resulting in a full partition.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   If you want to disable the job cache, set <option>job_cache</option> to
   'False':

    When the partition with job cache files gets full because of wrong
