 <para>
  As a &ceph; cluster administrator, you will be configuring and adjusting the
  cluster behavior by running specific commands. There are several types of
  commands you will need:
 </para>

 <sect2>
  <title>&salt;-related commands</title>
  <para>
   These commands help you to deploy &ceph; cluster nodes, run commands on
   several (or all) cluster nodes at the same time, or assist you when adding
   or removing cluster nodes. The most frequently used commands are
   <command>ceph-salt</command> and <command>ceph-salt config</command>. You
   need to run &salt; commands on the &smaster; node as &rootuser;. These
   commands are introduced with the following prompt:
  </para>
<screen>
&prompt.smaster;
</screen>
  <para>
   For example:
  </para>
<screen>
&prompt.smaster;ceph-salt config ls
</screen>
 </sect2>

 <sect2>
  <title>&ceph; related commands</title>
  <para>
   These are lower-level commands to configure and fine tune all aspects of the
   cluster and its gateways on the command line, for example
   <command>ceph</command>, <command>cephadm</command>, <command>rbd</command>,
   or <command>radosgw-admin</command>.
  </para>
  <para>
   To run &ceph; related commands, you need to have read access to a &ceph;
   key. The key's capabilities then define your privileges within the &ceph;
   environment. One option is to run &ceph; commands as &rootuser; (or via
   <command>sudo</command>) and use the unrestricted default keyring
   'ceph.client.admin.key'.
  </para>
  <para>
   The safer and recommended option is to create a more restrictive individual
   key for each administrator user and put it in a directory where the users
   can read it, for example:
  </para>
<screen>~/.ceph/ceph.client.<replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable>.keyring</screen>
  <tip>
   <title>Path to &ceph; keys</title>
   <para>
    To use a custom admin user and keyring, you need to specify the user name
    and path to the key each time you run the <command>ceph</command> command
    using the <option>-n client.<replaceable>USER_NAME</replaceable></option>
    and <option>--keyring <replaceable>PATH/TO/KEYRING</replaceable></option>
    options.
   </para>
   <para>
    To avoid this, include these options in the <varname>CEPH_ARGS</varname>
    variable in the individual users' <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> files.
   </para>
  </tip>
  <para>
   Although you can run &ceph;-related commands on any cluster node, we
   recommend running them on the &adm;. This documentation uses the &cephuser;
   user to run the commands, therefore they are introduced with the following
   prompt:
  </para>
<screen>
&prompt.cephuser;
</screen>
  <para>
   For example:
  </para>
<screen>
&prompt.cephuser;ceph auth list
</screen>
  <tip>
   <title>Commands for specific nodes</title>
   <para>
    If the documentation instructs you to run a command on a cluster node with
    a specific role, it will be addressed by the prompt. For example:
   </para>
<screen>
&prompt.cephuser.mon;
</screen>
  </tip>
  <sect3>
   <title>Running <command>ceph-volume</command></title>
   <para>
    Starting with &productname; 7, &ceph; services are running containerized.
    If you need to run <command>ceph-volume</command> on an OSD node, you need
    to prepend it with the <command>cephadm</command> command, for example:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;cephadm ceph-volume simple scan</screen>
  </sect3>
 </sect2>

 <sect2>
  <title>General Linux commands</title>
  <para>
   Linux commands not related to &ceph;, such as <command>mount</command>,
   <command>cat</command>, or <command>openssl</command>, are introduced either
   with the &prompt.cephuser; or &prompt.root; prompts, depending on which
   privileges the related command requires.
  </para>
 </sect2>
