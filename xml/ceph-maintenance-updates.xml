 <para>
  Several key packages in &productname; &productnumber; are based on the
  &cephname; release series of &ceph;. When the &ceph; project
  (<link xlink:href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph"/>) publishes new point
  releases in the &cephname; series, &productname; &productnumber; is updated
  to ensure that the product benefits from the latest upstream bugfixes and
  feature backports.
 </para>
 <para>
  This chapter contains summaries of notable changes contained in each upstream
  point release that has been&mdash;or is planned to be&mdash;included in the
  product.

 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 15.2.5 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <para>
  The &cephname; point release 15.2.5 brought the following fixes and other
  changes:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    &cephfs;: Automatic static subtree partitioning policies may now be
    configured using the new distributed and random ephemeral pinning extended
    attributes on directories. See the following documentation for more
    information:
    <link xlink:href="https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/cephfs/multimds/"/>
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Monitors now have a config option
    <option>mon_osd_warn_num_repaired</option>, which is set to 10 by default.
    If any OSD has repaired more than this many I/O errors in stored data a
    <literal>OSD_TOO_MANY_REPAIRS</literal> health warning is generated.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Now, when <literal>no scrub</literal> and/or <literal>no
    deep-scrub</literal> flags are set globally or per pool, scheduled scrubs
    of the type disabled will be aborted. All user initiated scrubs are NOT
    interrupted.
   </para>

   <para>
    Fixed an issue with osdmaps not being trimmed in a healthy cluster.

 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 15.2.4 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <para>
  The &cephname; point release 15.2.4 brought the following fixes and other
  changes:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    CVE-2020-10753: rgw: sanitize newlines in s3 CORSConfigurationâ€™s
    ExposeHeader
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    &ogw;: The <command>radosgw-admin</command> sub-commands dealing with
    orphans&mdash;<command>radosgw-admin orphans find</command>,
    <command>radosgw-admin orphans finish</command>, and <command>radosgw-admin
    orphans list-jobs</command>&mdash;have been deprecated. They had not been
    actively maintained, and since they store intermediate results on the
    cluster, they could potentially fill a nearly-full cluster. They have been
    replaced by a tool, <command>rgw-orphan-list</command>, which is currently
    considered experimental.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    RBD: The name of the RBD pool object that is used to store RBD trash purge
    schedule is changed from <literal>rbd_trash_trash_purge_schedule</literal>
    to <literal>rbd_trash_purge_schedule</literal>. Users that have already
    started using RBD trash purge schedule functionality and have per pool or
    namespace schedules configured should copy the
    <literal>rbd_trash_trash_purge_schedule</literal> object to
    <literal>rbd_trash_purge_schedule</literal> before the upgrade and remove
    <literal>rbd_trash_purge_schedule</literal> using the following commands in
    every RBD pool and namespace where a trash purge schedule was previously
    configured:
   </para>
<screen>
rados -p <replaceable>pool-name</replaceable> [-N namespace] cp rbd_trash_trash_purge_schedule rbd_trash_purge_schedule
rados -p <replaceable>pool-name</replaceable> [-N namespace] rm rbd_trash_trash_purge_schedule
</screen>
   <para>
    Alternatively, use any other convenient way to restore the schedule after
    the upgrade.
   </para>

 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 15.2.3 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The &cephname; point release 15.2.3 was a hotfix release to address an
    issue where WAL corruption was seen when
    <option>bluefs_preextend_wal_files</option> and
    <option>bluefs_buffered_io</option> were enabled at the same time. The fix
    in 15.2.3 is only a temporary measure (changing the default value of
    <option>bluefs_preextend_wal_files</option> to <literal>false</literal>).
    The permanent fix will be to remove the
    <option>bluefs_preextend_wal_files</option> option completely: this fix
    will most likely arrive in the 15.2.6 point release.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 15.2.2 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <para>

   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 15.2.1 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <para>
  The &cephname; point release 15.2.1 fixed an issue where upgrading quickly
  from Luminous (SES5.5) to Nautilus (SES6) to &cephname; (SES7) caused OSDs to
  crash. In addition, it patched two security vulnerabilities that were present
  in the initial &cephname; (15.2.0) release:
