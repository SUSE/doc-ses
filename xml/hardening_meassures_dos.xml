 <title>Preventing Denial Of Service (DoS)</title>
  <para>
    The most important piece in preventing DoS is to put proper quotas on users and groups to ensure that clients can't exhaust resources
    easily. While this is not the only way a client can impact your cluster, it's the easiest one and also can happen by accident.
    For details on how to setup quotas please refer to <xref linkend="cephfs-quotas"/> and <xref linkend="user-quota-managment"/>. Be aware that
    cephfs quotas are enforced client side, so a malicious client can ignore them and exceed it's limitations. If this is a concern in your
    environment don't use cephfs.

    To set the quotas conviniently you can use the dashboard

  <para>
    Current Ceph versions don't offer advanced ways of preventing malicious clients from attacking the availability of the cluster (e.g.
    with many open connections). To ensure you notice an attack or a misconfiguration you need to setup proper monitoring that will alert
    you if the cluster gets into a problematic state so you can investigate and if necessary act.
