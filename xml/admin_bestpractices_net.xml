  <title>Setting NTP to a &ceph; Cluster</title>

  <para>
   In a cluster environment, it is necessary to keep all cluster nodes' time
   synchronized. NTP&mdash;Network Time Protocol&mdash;is a network service
   commonly used for this purpose. NTP is well integrated in &suse; products,
   including &storage;. There are two ways to configure NTP&mdash;either using
   &yast;, or setting it up manually. Find both methods described&mdash;and
   more information on NTP in general&mdash;in

  <title>Firewall Settings for &ceph;</title>

  <para>
   We recommend protecting the network cluster communication with SUSE
   Firewall. You can edit its configuration by selecting
   <menuchoice><guimenu>&yast;</guimenu><guimenu>Security and
   Users</guimenu><guimenu>Firewall</guimenu><guimenu>Allowed
   Services</guimenu></menuchoice>.
  </para>

  <para>
   For Calamari, enable the "HTTP Server", "Carbon" and "SaltStack" services
   (ports 80, 2003, 2004, 4505 and 4506).
  </para>

  <para>
   For &ceph; monitor nodes, enable the "Ceph MON" service (port 6789).
  </para>

  <para>
   For &ceph; OSD (or MDS) nodes, enable the "Ceph OSD/MDS" service (ports
   6800-7300).

  <title>Adding a Private Network to a Running Cluster</title>

  <para>
   If you do not specify a cluster network during &ceph; deployment, it assumes
   a single public network environment. While &ceph; operates fine with a
   public network, its performance and security improves when you set a second
   private cluster network.
  </para>

  <para>
   A general recommendation for a &ceph; cluster is to have two networks: a
   public (front-side) and cluster (back-side) one. To support two networks,
   each &ceph; node needs to have at least two network cards.
  </para>

  <para>
   You need to apply the following changes to each &ceph; node. It is
   comfortable for a small cluster, but can be very time demanding if you have
   a cluster consisting of hundreds or thousands of nodes.
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Stop &ceph; related services on each cluster node.
    </para>
    <para>
     Replace <literal>10.0.0.0/24</literal> with the IP address and netmask of
     the cluster network. You can specify more comma-delimited subnets. If you
     need to specifically assign static IP addresses or override
     <option>cluster network</option> settings, you can do so with the optional
     <option>cluster addr</option>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check that the private cluster network works as expected on the OS level.
    </para>

     Start &ceph; related services on each cluster node.
