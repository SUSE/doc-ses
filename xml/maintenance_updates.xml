 <para>
  Several key packages in &productname; &productnumber; are based on the
  '&cephname;' release series of &ceph;. When the &ceph; project
  (<link xlink:href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph"/>) publishes new point
  releases in the &cephname; series. &productname; &productnumber; is updated
  to ensure that the product benefits from the latest upstream bugfixes and
  feature backports.
 </para>
 <para>
  This chapter contains summaries of notable changes contained in each upstream
  point release that has been&mdash;or is planned to be&mdash;included in the
  product.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="v14-2-4">
  <title>&cephname; 14.2.4 Point Release</title>

  <para>
   This point release fixes a serious regression that found its way into the
   14.2.3 point release. This regression did not affect &productname; customers
   because we did not ship a version based on 14.2.3.

     The &ogw; <option>num_rados_handles</option> has been removed. If you were
     using a value of <option>num_rados_handles</option> greater than 1,
     multiply your current <option>objecter_inflight_ops</option> and
     <option>objecter_inflight_op_bytes</option> parameters by the old
     <option>num_rados_handles</option> to get the same throttle behavior.

     The secure mode of Messenger v2 protocol is no longer experimental with
     this release. This mode is now the preferred mode of connection for
     monitors.

  <title>&cephname; 14.2.2 Point Release</title>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <literal>no{up,down,in,out}</literal> related commands have been
     revamped. There are now two ways to set the
     <literal>no{up,down,in,out}</literal> flags: the old <command>ceph osd
     [un]set <replaceable>FLAG</replaceable></command> command, which sets
     cluster-wide flags; and the new <command>ceph osd [un]set-group
     <replaceable>FLAGS</replaceable> <replaceable>WHO</replaceable></command>
     command, which sets flags in batch at the granularity of any crush node,
     or device class.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <command>radosgw-admin</command> introduces two subcommands that allow the
     managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a bucket
     reshard in earlier versions of &ogw;. One subcommand lists such objects
     and the other deletes them.
    </para>

    <para>
     Earlier &cephname; releases (14.2.1 and 14.2.0) have an issue where
     deploying a single new &cephname; &bluestore; OSD on an upgraded cluster
     (i.e. one that was originally deployed pre-&cephname;) breaks the pool
     utilization statistics reported by <command>ceph df</command>. Until all
     OSDs have been reprovisioned or updated (via <command>ceph-bluestore-tool
     repair</command>), the pool statistics will show values that are lower
     than the true value. This is resolved in 14.2.2, such that the cluster
     only switches to using the more accurate per-pool stats after
     <emphasis>all</emphasis> OSDs are 14.2.2 or later, are &blockstore;, and
     have been updated via the repair function if they were created prior to
     &cephname;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The default value for <option>mon_crush_min_required_version</option> has
     been changed from 'firefly' to 'hammer', which means the cluster will
     issue a health warning if your CRUSH tunables are older than 'hammer'.
     There is generally a small (but non-zero) amount of data that will move
     around by making the switch to 'hammer' tunables.
    </para>
    <para>
     If possible, we recommend that you set the oldest allowed client to
     'hammer' or later. To display what the current oldest allowed client is,
     run:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph osd dump | grep min_compat_client</screen>
    <para>
     If the current value is older than 'hammer', you can tell whether it is
     safe to make this change by verifying that there are no clients older than
     'hammer' currently connected to the cluster:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph features</screen>
    <para>
     The newer 'straw2' CRUSH bucket type was introduced in 'hammer', If you
     verify that all clients are 'hammer' or newer, it allows new features only
     supported for 'straw2' buckets to be used, including the 'crush-compat'
     mode for the Balancer (<xref linkend="mgr-modules-balancer" />).
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="v14-2-1">
  <title>&cephname; 14.2.1 Point Release</title>

  <para>
   This was the first point release following the original &cephname; release
   (14.2.0). The original ('General Availability' or 'GA') version of
   &productname; &productnumber; was based on this point release.
