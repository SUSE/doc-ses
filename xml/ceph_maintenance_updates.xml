 <para>
  Several key packages in &productname; &productnumber; are based on the
  &cephname; release series of &ceph;. When the &ceph; project
  (<link xlink:href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph"/>) publishes new point
  releases in the &cephname; series, &productname; &productnumber; is updated
  to ensure that the product benefits from the latest upstream bug fixes and
  feature backports.
 </para>
 <para>
  This chapter contains summaries of notable changes contained in each upstream
  point release that has been&mdash;or is planned to be&mdash;included in the
  product.

  <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 15.2.11 Point Release</bridgehead>
  <para>
  This release includes a security fix that ensures the
  <option>global_id</option> value (a numeric value that should be unique for
  every authenticated client or daemon in the cluster) is reclaimed after a
  network disconnect or ticket renewal in a secure fashion. Two new health
  alerts may appear during the upgrade indicating that there are clients or
  daemons that are not yet patched with the appropriate fix.
  </para>
  <para>
  To temporarily mute the health alerts around insecure clients for the
  duration of the upgrade, you may want to run:
  </para>
  <screen>
  &prompt.cephuser;ceph health mute AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM 1h
  &prompt.cephuser;ceph health mute AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM_ALLOWED 1h
  </screen>
  <para>
  When all clients are updated, enable the new secure behavior, not allowing
  old insecure clients to join the cluster:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph config set mon auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim false</screen>
  <para>
