 <para>
  Several key packages in &productname; &productnumber; are based on the
  &cephname; release series of &ceph;. When the &ceph; project
  (<link xlink:href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph"/>) publishes new point
  releases in the &cephname; series. &productname; &productnumber; is updated
  to ensure that the product benefits from the latest upstream bugfixes and
  feature backports.
 </para>
 <para>
  This chapter contains summaries of notable changes contained in each upstream
  point release that has been&mdash;or is planned to be&mdash;included in the
  product.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 14.2.4 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <para>
  This point release fixes a serious regression that found its way into the
  14.2.3 point release. This regression did not affect &productname; customers
  because we did not ship a version based on 14.2.3.
 </para>

    Fixed a denial of service vulnerability where an unauthenticated client of
    &cogw; could trigger a crash from an uncaught exception.

    The &ogw; <option>num_rados_handles</option> has been removed. If you were
    using a value of <option>num_rados_handles</option> greater than 1,
    multiply your current <option>objecter_inflight_ops</option> and
    <option>objecter_inflight_op_bytes</option> parameters by the old
    <option>num_rados_handles</option> to get the same throttle behavior.

    The secure mode of Messenger v2 protocol is no longer experimental with
    this release. This mode is now the preferred mode of connection for
    monitors.

   <para>
    <option>osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_key_threshold</option> has been

 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 14.2.2 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The <literal>no{up,down,in,out}</literal> related commands have been
    revamped. There are now two ways to set the
    <literal>no{up,down,in,out}</literal> flags: the old command
   </para>
<screen>ceph osd [un]set <replaceable>FLAG</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    which sets cluster-wide flags; and the new command
   </para>
<screen>ceph osd [un]set-group <replaceable>FLAGS</replaceable> <replaceable>WHO</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    which sets flags in batch at the granularity of any crush node, or device
    class.

   <para>
    <command>radosgw-admin</command> introduces two subcommands that allow the
    managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a bucket
    reshard in earlier versions of &ogw;. One subcommand lists such objects and
    the other deletes them.
   </para>

   <para>
    Earlier &cephname; releases (14.2.1 and 14.2.0) have an issue where
    deploying a single new &cephname; &bluestore; OSD on an upgraded cluster
    (i.e. one that was originally deployed pre-&cephname;) breaks the pool
    utilization statistics reported by <command>ceph df</command>. Until all
    OSDs have been reprovisioned or updated (via <command>ceph-bluestore-tool
    repair</command>), the pool statistics will show values that are lower than
    the true value. This is resolved in 14.2.2, such that the cluster only
    switches to using the more accurate per-pool stats after
    <emphasis>all</emphasis> OSDs are 14.2.2 or later, are &blockstore;, and
    have been updated via the repair function if they were created prior to
    &cephname;.
   </para>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    The default value for <option>mon_crush_min_required_version</option> has
    been changed from <literal>firefly</literal> to <literal>hammer</literal>,
    which means the cluster will issue a health warning if your CRUSH tunables
    are older than Hammer. There is generally a small (but non-zero) amount of
    data that will move around by making the switch to Hammer tunables.
   </para>
   <para>
    If possible, we recommend that you set the oldest allowed client to
    <literal>hammer</literal> or later. To display what the current oldest
    allowed client is, run:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph osd dump | grep min_compat_client</screen>
   <para>
    If the current value is older than <literal>hammer</literal>, run the
    following command to determine whether it is safe to make this change by
    verifying that there are no clients older than Hammer currently connected
    to the cluster:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph features</screen>
   <para>
    The newer <literal>straw2</literal> CRUSH bucket type was introduced in
    Hammer. If you verify that all clients are Hammer or newer, it allows new
    features only supported for <literal>straw2</literal> buckets to be used,
    including the <literal>crush-compat</literal> mode for the Balancer
    (<xref linkend="mgr-modules-balancer" />).

 <bridgehead renderas="sect1">&cephname; 14.2.1 Point Release</bridgehead>
 <para>
  This was the first point release following the original &cephname; release
  (14.2.0). The original ('General Availability' or 'GA') version of
  &productname; &productnumber; was based on this point release.
