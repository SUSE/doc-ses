 <para>
  If you come across a problem when running &productname; &productnumber;
  related to some of its components, such as &ceph; or &rgw;, report the
  problem to SUSE Technical Support. The recommended way is with the
  <command>supportconfig</command> utility.
 </para>
 <tip>
  <para>
   Because <command>supportconfig</command> is modular software, make sure
   that the <systemitem>supportutils-plugin-ses</systemitem> package is
   installed.
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;rpm -q supportutils-plugin-ses</screen>
  <para>
   If it is missing on the &ceph; server, install it with:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;zypper ref &amp;&amp; zypper in supportutils-plugin-ses</screen>
  <para>
    <literal>supportutils-plugin-ses</literal> will try to capture as much
    useful information as it can about both the &ceph; cluster as a whole,
    and about the host on which it is running. Some information, including
    the &ceph; daemon's status, <command>podman</command> image information, <command>rpm</command> verification and some
    relevant configuration data will be saved to the <filename>plugin-ses.txt</filename> file
    inside the <filename>supportconfig</filename> <command>tar</command> archive. A lot more information, including
    overall cluster status, logs, and diagnostic data for each currently
    running &ceph; daemon will be saved to files in the &ceph; subdirectory
    inside the supportconfig tar archive.
  </para>
 </tip>
 <para>
   When <command>supportconfig</command> is run on an &adm;, it will
   be able to capture the overall status of the entire cluster. For example,
   <command>ceph status</command> and <command>ceph health</command>. If the
   <filename>ceph.conf</filename> file and admin keyring are not present, it will not be able to
   capture overall cluster status, but still capture diagnostic data for
   each currently running &ceph; daemon.
 </para>
 <para>
   In general, when using <command>supportconfig</command>, you will want to run it on an admin
   node (to ensure the overall cluster status is captured), as well as on
   any other nodes that are experiencing problems, to ensure it captures
   diagnostic data for anything and everything that may be relevant.
 </para>
 <para>
  Although you can use <command>supportconfig</command> on the command line,
  we recommend using the related &yast; module. Find more information about
  <command>supportconfig</command> in
