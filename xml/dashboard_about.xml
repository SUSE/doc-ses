 <para>
  The &dashboard; is a built-in Web-based &ceph; management and monitoring
  application that administers various aspects and objects of the cluster. The
  dashboard is automatically enabled after the basic cluster is deployed in
  <xref linkend="deploy-cephadm-day1"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  The &dashboard; for &productname; &productnumber; has added more Web-based
  management capabilities to make it easier to administer &ceph;, including
  monitoring and application administration to the &mgr;. You no longer need to
  know complex &ceph;-related commands to manage and monitor your &ceph;
  cluster. You can either use the &dashboard;'s intuitive interface, or its
  built-in REST API.
 </para>
 <para>
  The &dashboard; module visualizes information and statistics about the &ceph;
  cluster using a web server hosted by <literal>ceph-mgr</literal>. See
  <xref linkend="storage-intro-core-nodes" /> for more details on &mgr;.
