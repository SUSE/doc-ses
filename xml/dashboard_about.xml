  The &dashboard; is a module that adds a built-in Web based monitoring and
  administration application to the &mgr; (refer to
  <xref linkend="storage-intro-core-nodes" /> for more details on &mgr;). You
  no longer need to know complex &ceph; related commands to manage and monitor
  your &ceph; cluster. You can either use the &dashboard;'s intuitive Web
  interface, or its built-in REST API.

 <para>
  The &dashboard; is automatically enabled and configured with &deepsea;'s
  stage 3 during the deployment procedure (see
  <xref linkend="ceph-install-stack" />). In a &ceph; cluster with multiple
  &mgr; instances, only the dashboard running on the currently active &mgr;
  daemon will serve incoming requests. Accessing the dashboard's TCP port on
  any of the other &mgr; instances that are currently on standby will perform
  an HTTP redirect (303) to the currently active &mgr;'s dashboard URL. This
  way, you can point your browser to any of the &mgr; instances in order to
  access the dashboard. Consider this behavior when securing access with
  firewall or planning for HA setup.
