 <para>
  As a &ceph; cluster administrator, you will be configuring and adjusting the
  cluster behavior by running specific commands. There are several types of
  commands you will need:
 </para>
 <sect1>
  <title>&salt; Related Commands</title>

  <para>
   These commands help you to deploy &ceph; cluster nodes, run commands on
   several (or all) cluster nodes at the same time, or assist you when adding
   or removing cluster nodes. The most frequently used commands are
   <command>salt</command> and <command>salt-run</command>. You need to run
   &salt; commands on the &smaster; node as &rootuser;. These commands are
   introduced with the following prompt:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.smaster;
</screen>

  <para>
   For example:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.smaster;salt '*.example.net' test.ping
</screen>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>&ceph; Related Commands</title>

  <para>
   These are lower level commands to configure and fine tune all aspects of the
   cluster and its gateways on the command line, for example
   <command>ceph</command>, <command>rbd</command>,
   <command>radosgw-admin</command>, or <command>crushtool</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
   To run &ceph; related commands, you need to have read access to a &ceph;
   key. The key's capabilities then define your privileges within the &ceph;
   environment. One option is to run &ceph; commands as &rootuser; (or via
   <command>sudo</command>) and use the unrestricted default keyring
   'ceph.client.admin.key'.
  </para>

  <para>
   Safer and recommended option is to create a more restrictive individual key
   for each administrator user and put it in a directory where the users can
   read it, for example:
  </para>

<screen>~/.ceph/ceph.client.<replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable>.keyring</screen>

  <tip>
   <title>Path to &ceph; Keys</title>
   <para>
    To use a custom admin user and keyring, you need to specify the user name
    and path to the key each time you run the <command>ceph</command> command
    using the <option>-n client.<replaceable>USER_NAME</replaceable></option>
    and <option>--keyring <replaceable>PATH/TO/KEYRING</replaceable></option>
    options.
   </para>
   <para>
    To avoid this, include these options in the <varname>CEPH_ARGS</varname>
    variable in the individual users' <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> files.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   Although you can run &ceph; related commands on any cluster node, we
   recommend running them on the &adm;. This documentation uses the &cephuser;
   user to run the commands, therefore they are introduced with the following
   prompt:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.cephuser;
</screen>

  <para>
   For example:
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.cephuser;ceph auth list
</screen>

  <tip>
   <title>Commands for Specific Nodes</title>
   <para>
    If the documentation instructs you to run a command on a cluster node with
    a specific role, it will be addressed by the prompt. For example:
   </para>
<screen>
&prompt.cephuser.mon;
</screen>
  </tip>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>General Linux Commands</title>

  <para>
   Linux commands not related to &ceph; or &deepsea;, such as
   <command>mount</command>, <command>cat</command>, or
   <command>openssl</command>, are introduced either with the &prompt.cephuser;
   or &prompt.root; prompts, depending on which privileges the related command
   requires.
  </para>
