 <title>Troubleshooting</title>
 <para>
 	This chapter describes several issues that you may face when you operate a &ceph; cluster.
 	</para>
 	<sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.cluster_mntc.rados_striping">
  <title>Sending Large Objects with <command>rados</command> Fails with Full OSD</title>

  <para>
   <command>rados</command> is a command line utility to manage RADOS object
   storage. For more information, see <command>man 8 rados</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you send a large object to a &ceph; cluster with the
   <command>rados</command> utility, such as
  </para>

<screen>rados -p mypool put myobject /file/to/send</screen>

  <para>
   it can fill up all the related OSD space and cause serious trouble to the
   cluster performance. RADOS has a 'striper' API that enables applications to
   stripe large objects over multiple OSDs. If you turn the striping feature on
   with the <option>--striper</option> option, you can prevent the OSD from
   filling up.
  </para>

<screen>rados --striper -p mypool put myobject /file/to/send</screen>

 <sect1 xml:id="ceph.xfs.corruption">
 	<title>Corrupted XFS Filesystem</title>
 	<para>
 	In rare circumstances like kernel bug or broken/misconfigured hardware, the underlying file system (XFS) in which an OSD stores its data might be damaged and unmountable.
 	</para>
 	<para>
 	If you are sure there is no problem with your hardware and the system is configured properly, raise a bug against the XFS subsytem of the &sls; kernel and mark the particular OSD as down:
 	</para>
 	<screen>ceph osd down <replaceable>OSD identification</replaceable></screen>
 	<warning>
 	<title>Do Not Format or Otherwise Modify the Damaged Device</title>
 	<para>
 	Even though using <command>xfs_repair</command> to fix the problem in the filesystem may seem reasonable, do not use it as the command modifies the file system. The OSD may start but its functioning may be influenced. 
 	</para>
 	</warning>
 	<para>
 	Now zap the underlying disk and recreate the OSD by running:
 	</para>
 	<screen>ceph-disk prepare --zap $OSD_DISK_DEVICE $OSD_JOURNAL_DEVICE"</screen>
 	<para>for example:</para>
 	<screen>ceph-disk prepare --zap /dev/sdb /dev/sdd2</screen>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.recover.toomanypgs">
  <title>'Too Many PGs per OSD' Status Message</title>

  <para>
   If you receive a <literal>Too Many PGs per OSD</literal> message after
   running <command>ceph status</command>, it means that the
   <option>mon_pg_warn_max_per_osd</option> value (300 by default) was
   exceeded. This value is compared to the number of PGs per OSD ratio. This
   means that the cluster setup is not optimal.
  </para>

  <para>
   As the number of PGs cannot be reduced after the pool is created, the only
   solution is to add OSDs to the cluster so that the ratio of PGs per OSD
   becomes lower.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.recover.stalecalamari">
  <title>Calamari Has a Stale Cluster</title>

  <para>
   The Calamari back-end supports operating multiple clusters, while its
   front-end does not yet. This means that if you point Calamari at one
   cluster, then destroy that cluster and create a new one, and then point the
   same Calamari instance at the new cluster, it will still remember the old
   cluster and possibly/probably try to display the old cluster state by
   default.
  </para>

  <para>
   To make Calamari 'forget' the old cluster, run:
  </para>

<screen>sudo systemctl stop cthulhu.service
sudo calamari-ctl clear --yes-i-am-sure
sudo calamari-ctl initialize</screen>

  <para>
   This will make Calamari forget all the old clusters it knows about. It will,
   however, not clear out the salt minion keys from the master. This is fine if
   you are reusing the same nodes for the new cluster.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.recover.stuckinactive">
  <title>'<emphasis>nn</emphasis> pg stuck inactive' Status Message</title>

  <para>
   If you receive a <literal>stuck inactive</literal> status message after
   running <command>ceph status</command>, it means that &ceph; does not know
   where to replicate the stored data to fulfill the replication rules. It can
   happen shortly after the initial &ceph; setup and fix itself automatically.
   In other cases, this may require a manual interaction, such as bringing up a
   broken OSD, or adding a new OSD to the cluster. In very rare cases, reducing
   the replication level may help.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the placement groups are stuck perpetually, you need to check the output
   of <command>ceph osd tree</command>. The output should look tree-structured,
   similar to the example in <xref linkend="storage.bp.recover.osddown"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the output of <command>ceph osd tree</command> is rather flat as in the
   following example
  </para>

<screen>ceph osd tree
ID WEIGHT TYPE NAME    UP/DOWN REWEIGHT PRIMARY-AFFINITY
-1      0 root default
 0      0 osd.0             up  1.00000          1.00000
 1      0 osd.1             up  1.00000          1.00000
 2      0 osd.2             up  1.00000          1.00000</screen>

  <para>
   you should check that the related CRUSH map has a tree structure. If it is
   also flat, or with no hosts as in the above example, it may mean that host
   name resolution is not working correctly across the cluster.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.recover.osdweight">
  <title>OSD Weight is 0</title>

  <para>
   When OSD starts, it is assigned a weight. The higher the weight, the bigger
   the chance that the cluster writes data to the OSD. The weight is either
   specified in a cluster &crushmap;, or calculated by the OSDs' start-up
   script.
  </para>

  <para>
   In some cases, the calculated value for OSDs' weight may be rounded down to
   zero. It means that the OSD is not scheduled to store data, and no data is
   written to it. The reason is usually that the disk is too small (smaller
   than 15GB) and should be replaced with a bigger one.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.recover.osddown">
  <title>OSD is Down</title>

  <para>
   OSD daemon is either running, or stopped/down. There are 3 general reasons
   why an OSD is down:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Hard disk failure.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The OSD crashed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The server crashed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   You can see the detailed status of OSDs by running
  </para>

<screen>ceph osd tree
# id  weight  type name up/down reweight
 -1    0.02998  root default
 -2    0.009995   host doc-ceph1
 0     0.009995      osd.0 up  1
 -3    0.009995   host doc-ceph2
 1     0.009995      osd.1 up  1
 -4    0.009995   host doc-ceph3
 2     0.009995      osd.2 down  1</screen>

  <para>
   The example listing shows that the <literal>osd.2</literal> is down. Then
   you may check if the disk where the OSD is located is mounted:
  </para>

<screen>lsblk -f
 [...]
 vdb
 ├─vdb1               /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-2
 └─vdb2</screen>

  <para>
   You can track the reason why the OSD is down by inspecting its log file
   <filename>/var/log/ceph/ceph-osd.2.log</filename>. After you find and fix
   the reason why the OSD is not running, start it with
  </para>

<screen>sudo systemctl start ceph-osd@2.service</screen>

  <para>
   Do not forget to replace <literal>2</literal> with the actual number of your
   stopped OSD.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="storage.bp.recover.clockskew">
  <title>Fixing Clock Skew Warnings</title>

  <para>
   The time information in all cluster nodes must be synchronized. If a node's
   time is not fully synchronized, you may get clock skew warnings when
   checking the state of the cluster.
  </para>

  <para>
   Time synchronization is managed with NTP (see
   <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol"/>).
   Set each node to synchronize its time with one or more NTP servers,
   preferably to the same group of NTP servers. If the time skew still occurs
   on a node, follow these steps to fix it:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl stop ntpd.service
systemctl stop ceph-mon.target
systemctl start ntpd.service
systemctl start ceph-mon.target</screen>

  <para>
   You can then query the NTP peers and check the time offset with
   <command>sudo ntpq -p</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The &ceph; monitors need to have their clocks synchronized to within 0.05
   seconds of each other. In a typical
   <systemitem class="daemon">ntpd</systemitem> configuration with remote NTP
   servers, it may be impossible for
   <systemitem class="daemon">ntpd</systemitem> to reliably maintain this
   degree of accuracy. In such cases, the &ceph; developers recommend running
   an NTP server in the local network.
  </para>
