  <title>General Upgrade Procedure</title>

  <para>
   Before upgrading the &ceph; cluster, you need to have both the underlying
   &sls; and &storage; correctly registered against SCC or SMT. You can upgrade
   daemons in your cluster while the cluster is online and in service. Certain
   types of daemons depend upon others. For example &ceph; &rgw;s depend upon
   &ceph; monitors and &ceph; OSD daemons. We recommend upgrading in this
   order:

    We recommend upgrading all the daemons of a specific type&mdash;for example
    all monitor daemons or all OSD daemons&mdash;one by one to ensure that they
    are all on the same release. We also recommend that you upgrade all the
    daemons in your cluster before you try to exercise new functionality in a
    release.
   </para>
   <para>
    After all the daemons of a specific type are upgraded, check their status.

    Ensure each monitor has rejoined the quorum after all monitors are
    upgraded:

  <sect2 xml:id="ceph.upgrade.luminous_flag">
   <title>Set require_luminous_osds osdmap Flag</title>
   <para>
    When the last OSD is upgraded from &storage;; 3 or 4 to 5, the monitor
    nodes will detect that all OSDs are running the 'luminous' version of
    &ceph; and they may complain that the
    <option>require_luminous_osds</option> osdmap flag is not set. In that
    case, you need to set this flag manually to acknowledge that&mdash;now that
    the cluster has been upgraded to 'luminous'&mdash;it cannot be downgraded
    back to &ceph; 'jewel'. Set the flag by running the following command:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sminion;sudo osd set require_luminous_osds</screen>
   <para>
    After the command completes, the warning disappears.
   </para>
   <para>
    On fresh installs of &storage; 5, this flag is set automatically when the
    &ceph; monitors create the initial osdmap, so no end-user action is needed.

    You need to have the following software installed and updated to the latest

      Check whether the &aa; service is running and disable it on each cluster
      node. Start &yast; &aa; module, and select <guimenu>Settings</guimenu>

      You cannot proceed with the upgrade procedure if there are OSDs assigned
      to the &smaster;. You can check for it by running
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt '<replaceable>salt_master_name</replaceable>' pillar.get roles</screen>
     <para>
      If the output of the previous command lists the word 'storage', stop the
      upgrade and merge the OSDs away from &smaster;. Refer to

     <para>
      Although the cluster is fully functional during the upgrade, &deepsea;
      sets the 'noout' flag which prevents &ceph; from rebalancing data during
      downtime and therefore avoids unnecessary data transfers.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To optimize the upgrade process, &deepsea; upgrades your nodes in the
      order, based on their assigned role as recommended by &ceph; upstream:
      MONs, MGRs, OSDs, MDS, RGW, IGW, and NFS Ganesha.
     </para>
     <para>
      Note that &deepsea; cannot prevent from violating the prescribed order if
      a node runs multiple services.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Although the &ceph; cluster is operational during the upgrade, nodes may
      get rebooted in order to apply for example new kernel versions. To reduce
      waiting I/O operations, we recommend declining incoming requests for the
      duration of the upgrade process.

   <title>Upgrade Failure</title>
   <para>
    If the cluster is in 'HEALTH_ERR' state for more than 300 seconds, or one
    of the services for each assigned role is down for more than 900 seconds,
    the upgrade failed. In that case, try to find the problem, resolve it, and
    re-run the upgrade procedure. Note that in virtualized environments, the
    timeouts are shorter.
   </para>
  </important>

  <important>
   <title>Rebooting OSDs</title>
   <para>
    After upgrade to &storage; 5, FileStore OSDs need approximately 5 minutes
    longer to start as the OSD will do a one-off conversion of its on-disk
    files.

  <tip>
   <title>Check for the Version of Cluster Components/Nodes</title>
   <para>
    When you need to find out the versions of individual cluster components and
    nodes&mdash;for example to find out if all your nodes are actually on the
    same patch level after the upgrade, you can run
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt-run status.report</screen>
   <para>
    The command goes through the connected &sminion;s and scans for the version
    numbers of &ceph;, &salt;, &sls;, and gives you a report displaying the
    version that the majority of nodes have and shows nodes whose version is
    different from the majority.
