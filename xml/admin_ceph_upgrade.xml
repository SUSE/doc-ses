  <title>General Upgrade Procedure</title>

  <para>
   Before upgrading the &ceph; cluster, you need to have both the underlying
   &sls; and &storage; correctly registered against SCC or SMT. You can upgrade
   daemons in your cluster while the cluster is online and in service. Certain
   types of daemons depend upon others. For example &ceph; &rgw;s depend upon
   &ceph; monitors and &ceph; OSD daemons. We recommend upgrading in this
   order:

    We recommend upgrading all the daemons of a specific type&mdash;for example
    all monitor daemons or all OSD daemons&mdash;one by one to ensure that they
    are all on the same release. We also recommend that you upgrade all the
    daemons in your cluster before you try to exercise new functionality in a
    release.
   </para>

    After all the daemons of a specific type are upgraded, check their status.

   <title>Set require-osd-release luminous Flag</title>
   <para>
    When the last OSD is upgraded to &storage; 5, the monitor nodes will detect
    that all OSDs are running the 'luminous' version of &ceph; and they may
    complain that the <option>require-osd-release luminous</option> osdmap flag
    is not set. In that case, you need to set this flag manually to acknowledge
    that&mdash;now that the cluster has been upgraded to 'luminous'&mdash;it
    cannot be downgraded back to &ceph; 'jewel'. Set the flag by running the
    following command:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sminion;sudo ceph osd require-osd-release luminous</screen>
   <para>
    After the command completes, the warning disappears.
   </para>
   <para>
    On fresh installs of &storage; 5, this flag is set automatically when the
    &ceph; monitors create the initial osdmap, so no end user action is needed.

      To optimize the upgrade process, &deepsea; upgrades your nodes in the

     <para>
      If <literal>ceph.stage.3</literal> fails with "Error EINVAL: entity
      client.bootstrap-osd exists but caps do not match", it means the key
      capabilities (caps) for the existing cluster's
      <literal>client.bootstrap.osd</literal> key do not match the caps that
      &deepsea; is trying to set. Above the error message, in red text, you can
      see a dump of the <command>ceph auth</command> command that failed. Look
      at this command to check the key ID and file being used. In the case of
      <literal>client.bootstrap-osd</literal>, the command will be
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;ceph auth add client.bootstrap-osd \
 -i /srv/salt/ceph/osd/cache/bootstrap.keyring</screen>
     <para>
      To fix mismatched key caps, check the content of the keyring file
      &deepsea; is trying to deploy, for example:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.cephuser;cat /srv/salt/ceph/osd/cache/bootstrap.keyring
[client.bootstrap-osd]
     key = AQD6BpVZgqVwHBAAQerW3atANeQhia8m5xaigw==

     caps mon = "allow profile bootstrap-osd"</screen>

      Compare this with the output of <command>ceph auth get

exported keyring for client.bootstrap-osd
[client.bootstrap-osd]
     key = AQD6BpVZgqVwHBAAQerW3atANeQhia8m5xaigw==
     caps mon = "allow profile bootstrap-osd"</screen>
     <para>
      Note how the latter key is missing <literal>caps mgr = "allow

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph auth caps client.bootstrap-osd mgr \
 "allow r" mon "allow profile bootstrap-osd"</screen>
     <para>
      Running <literal>ceph.stage.3</literal> should now succeed.
     </para>
     <para>
      The same issue can occur with &mds; and &ogw; keyrings when running
      <literal>ceph.stage.4</literal>. The same procedure as above applies:
      check the command that failed, the keyring file being deployed, and the
      caps of the existing key. Then run <command>ceph auth caps</command> to
      update the existing key caps to match what is being deployed by
      &deepsea;.

   <title>Upgrade Failure</title>
   <para>
    If the cluster is in 'HEALTH_ERR' state for more than 300 seconds, or one
    of the services for each assigned role is down for more than 900 seconds,
    the upgrade failed. In that case, try to find the problem, resolve it, and
    re-run the upgrade procedure. Note that in virtualized environments, the
    timeouts are shorter.
   </para>

  <important>
   <title>Rebooting OSDs</title>
   <para>
    After upgrading to &storage; 5, FileStore OSDs need approximately five
    minutes longer to start as the OSD will do a one-off conversion of its
    on-disk files.

  <tip>
   <title>Check for the Version of Cluster Components/Nodes</title>
   <para>
    When you need to find out the versions of individual cluster components and
    nodes&mdash;for example to find out if all your nodes are actually on the
    same patch level after the upgrade&mdash;you can run
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt-run status.report</screen>
   <para>
    The command goes through the connected &sminion;s and scans for the version
    numbers of &ceph;, &salt;, and &sls;, and gives you a report displaying the
    version that the majority of nodes have and showing nodes whose version is
    different from the majority.

  <sect2 xml:id="filestore2bluestore">
   <title>OSD Migration to &bluestore;</title>
   <para>
    OSD &bluestore; is a new back end for the OSD daemons. It is the default
    option since &storage; 5. Compared to FileStore, which stores objects
    as files in an XFS filesystem, &bluestore; can deliver increased performance
    because it stores objects directly on the underlying block device.
    &bluestore; also enables other features, such as built-in compression
    and EC overwrites, that are unavailable with FileStore.
   </para>
   <para>
    Specifically for &bluestore;, an OSD has a 'wal' (Write Ahead Log) device
    and a 'db' (RocksDB database) device. The RocksDB database holds the
    metadata for a &bluestore; OSD. These two devices will reside on the same
    device as an OSD by default, but either can be placed on faster/different
    media.
   </para>
   <para>
    In SES5, both FileStore and &bluestore; are supported and it is possible
    for FileStore and &bluestore; OSDs to co-exist in a single cluster.
    During the SUSE Enterprise Storage upgrade procedure, FileStore OSDs
    are not automatically converted to &bluestore;. Be aware that the
    &bluestore;-specific features will not be available on OSDs that have
    not been migrated to &bluestore;.
   </para>
   <para>
    Before converting to &bluestore;, the OSDs need to be running &storage; 5.
    The conversion is a slow process as all data gets re-written twice.
    Though the migration process can take a long time to complete, there
    is no cluster outage and all clients can continue accessing the cluster
    during this period. However, do expect lower performance for the duration
    of the migration. This is caused by rebalancing and backfilling of
    cluster data.
   </para>
   <para>
    Use the following procedure to migrate FileStore OSDs to &bluestore;:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Migrate hardware profiles:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.smaster;salt-run state.orch ceph.migrate.policy</screen>
     <para>
      This runner migrates any hardware profiles currently in use by the
      <filename>policy.cfg</filename> file. It processes
      <filename>policy.cfg</filename>, finds any hardware profile using the
      original data structure, and converts it to the new data structure. The
      result is a new hardware profile named
      'migrated-<replaceable>original_name</replaceable>'.
      <filename>policy.cfg</filename> is updated as well.
     </para>
     <para>
      If the original configuration had separate journals, the &bluestore;
      configuration will use the same device for the 'wal' and 'db' for that
      OSD.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      &deepsea; migrates OSDs by setting their weight to 0 which 'vacuums' the
      data until the OSD is empty. You can either migrate OSDs one by one, or
      all OSDs at once. In either case, when the OSD is empty, the
      orchestration removes it and then re-creates it with the new
      configuration.
     </para>
     <tip>
      <title>Recommended Method</title>
      <para>
       Use <command>ceph.migrate.nodes</command> if you have a large number of
       physical storage nodes or almost no data. If one node represents less
       than 10% of your capacity, then the
       <command>ceph.migrate.nodes</command> may be marginally faster moving
       all the data from those OSDs in parallel.
      </para>
      <para>
       If you are not sure about which method to use, or the site has few
       storage nodes (for example each node has more than 10% of the cluster
       data), then select <command>ceph.migrate.osds</command>.
