      The upgrade of core services (MON, MGR, OSD) happens in an orderly
      fashion. Each service is available during the upgrade. The gateway
      services (&mds;, &ogw;, &ganesha;, &igw;) need to be redeployed after the
      core services are upgraded. There is a certain amount of downtime for
      each of the following services:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <important>
        <para>
         &mds;s and &ogw;s are down from the time the nodes are upgraded from
         &prevcephos; to &cephos; until the services are redeployed at the end
         of the upgrade procedure. This is particularly important to bear in
         mind if these services are colocated with MONs, MGRs or OSDs, because
         in this case they may be down for the entire duration of the cluster
         upgrade. If this is going to be a problem, consider deploying these
         services separately on additional nodes before upgrading, so that they
         are down for the least amount of time possible. This is the duration
         of the upgrade of the gateway nodes, not the duration of the upgrade
         of the entire cluster.

   <title>Backing Up cluster configuration and data</title>

    We strongly recommend backing up all cluster configuration and data before
    starting your upgrade to &productname; &productnumber;. For instruction on

    In case you previously upgraded from version 5, verify that the upgrade to
    version 6 was completed successfully:

   <para>
    Check for the existence of the
    <filename>/srv/salt/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.import</filename>
    file.
   </para>
   <para>
    This file is created by the engulf process during the upgrade from
    &productname; 5 to 6. The <option>configuration_init:
    default-import</option> option is set in
    <filename>/srv/pillar/ceph/proposals/config/stack/default/ceph/cluster.yml</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    If <option>configuration_init</option> is still set to
    <option>default-import</option>, the cluster is using
    <filename>ceph.conf.import</filename> as its configuration file and not
    &deepsea;'s default <filename>ceph.conf</filename> which is compiled from
    files in
    <filename>/srv/salt/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Therefore, you need to inspect <filename>ceph.conf.import</filename> for
    any custom configuration, and possibly move the configuration to one of the
    files in
    <filename>/srv/salt/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/</filename>.

   <para>
    Then remove the <option>configuration_init: default-import</option> line

    On a per node basis, an existing &ganesha; service needs to be stopped and

     <para>

    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      After the existing &ganesha; service has been stopped, a new one can be
      deployed in a container using &cephadm;. To do so, you need to create a
      service specification that contains a <literal>service_id</literal> that
      will be used to identify this new NFS cluster, the host name of the node
      we are migrating listed as a host in the placement specification, and the
      RADOS pool and namespace that contains the configured NFS export objects.
      For example:
     </para>
<screen>service_type: nfs
service_id: <replaceable>SERVICE_ID</replaceable>
placement:
  hosts:
  - node2
  pool: ganesha_config
  namespace: ganesha

    <step>
     <para>
      Apply the placement specification:

<screen>&prompt.cephuser;ceph orch apply -i <replaceable>FILENAME</replaceable>.yaml</screen>

    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Repeat these steps for each &ganesha; node. You do not need to create a
      separate service specification for each node. It is sufficient to add
      each node's host name to the existing NFS service specification and
      re-apply it.

      Pools in &productname; 6 had the <option>pg_autoscale_mode</option> set

      <option>pg_autoscale_mode</option> option is set to <option>on</option>
      for new pools and PGs will actually autoscale. The upgrade process does
      not automatically change the <option>pg_autoscale_mode</option> of
      existing pools. If you want to change it to <option>on</option> to get
