 <para>
  <emphasis>&adm;</emphasis> is a &ceph; cluster node where the
  &smaster; service is running. The admin node is a central point of the &ceph;
  cluster because it manages the rest of the cluster nodes by querying and
  instructing their &sminion; services. It usually includes other services as
  well, for example the &dashboard; Web UI with the <emphasis>&grafana;</emphasis>
  dashboard backed by the <emphasis>&prometheus;</emphasis> monitoring toolkit.
 </para>
 <para>
  In case of the &adm; failure, you usually need to provide a new
  working hardware for the node and restore the complete cluster configuration
  stack from a recent backup. Such method is time consuming and causes cluster
  outage.
 </para>
 <para>
  To prevent the &ceph; cluster performance downtime caused by the admin node
  failure, we recommend to make use of the &ha; (HA) cluster for the &ceph;
  admin node.

  <title>Outline of the HA Cluster for &adm;</title>

  <para>
   The idea of an HA cluster is that in case of one cluster node failure, the
   other node automatically takes over its role including the virtualized
   &adm;. This way other &ceph; cluster nodes do not notice that
   the &adm; failed.
  </para>

  <para>
   The minimal HA solution for the &adm; requires the following
   hardware:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Two bare metal servers able to run &sle; with the &ha; extension and
     virtualize the &adm;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Two or more redundant network communication paths, for example via Network
     Device Bonding.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Shared storage to host the disk image(s) of the &adm; virtual
     machine. The shared storage needs to be accessible form both servers. It
     can be for example an NFS export, a Samba share, or &iscsi; target.
    </para>

  <title>Building HA Cluster with &adm;</title>

  <para>
   The following procedure summarizes the most important steps of building the
   HA cluster for virtualizing the &adm;. For details, refer to the
   indicated links.
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Set up a basic 2-node HA cluster with shared storage as described in
     <link
      xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-15/book_sleha_quickstarts/data/art_sleha_install_quick.html"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     On both cluster nodes, install all packages required for running the &kvm;
     hypervisor and the &libvirt; toolkit as described in
     <link
      xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_virt/data/sec_vt_installation_kvm.html"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     On the first cluster node, create a new &kvm; virtual machine (VM) making
     use of &libvirt; as described in
     <link
      xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_virt/data/sec_libvirt_inst_vmm.html"/>.
     Use the preconfigured shared storage to store the disk images of the VM.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     After the VM setup is complete, export its configuration to an XML file on
     the shared storage. Use the following syntax:
    </para>
<screen>
&prompt.root;virsh dumpxml <replaceable>VM_NAME</replaceable> > /path/to/shared/vm_name.xml
</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Create a resource for the &adm; VM. Refer to
     <link
      xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-15/book_sleha_guide/data/cha_conf_hawk2.html"/>
     for general info on creating HA resources. Detailed info on creating
     resource for a &kvm; virtual machine is described in
     <link
      xlink:href="http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/VirtualDomain_%28resource_agent%29"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     On the newly created VM guest, deploy the &adm; including the
     additional services you need there. Follow relevant steps in
     <xref linkend="ceph.install.stack"/>. At the same time, deploy the
     remaining &ceph; cluster nodes on the non-HA cluster servers.
