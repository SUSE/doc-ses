 <para>
  The CRUSH algorithm determines how to store and retrieve data by computing
  data storage locations. CRUSH empowers &ceph; clients to communicate with
  OSDs directly rather than through a centralized server or broker. With an
  algorithmically determined method of storing and retrieving data, &ceph;
  avoids a single point of failure, a performance bottleneck, and a physical
  limit to its scalability.
 </para>
 <para>
  CRUSH requires a map of your cluster, and uses the &crushmap; to
  pseudo-randomly store and retrieve data in OSDs with a uniform distribution
  of data across the cluster.
 </para>
 <para>
  CRUSH maps contain a list of OSDs, a list of 'buckets' for aggregating the
  devices into physical locations, and a list of rules that tell CRUSH how it
  should replicate data in a &ceph; cluster’s pools. By reflecting the
  underlying physical organization of the installation, CRUSH can model—and
  thereby address—potential sources of correlated device failures. Typical
  sources include physical proximity, a shared power source, and a shared
  network. By encoding this information into the cluster map, CRUSH placement
  policies can separate object replicas across different failure domains while
  still maintaining the desired distribution. For example, to address the
  possibility of concurrent failures, it may be desirable to ensure that data
  replicas are on devices using different shelves, racks, power supplies,
  controllers, and/or physical locations.
 </para>
 <para>
  After you deploy a &ceph; cluster, a default &crushmap; is generated. It is
  fine for your &ceph; sandbox environment. However, when you deploy a
  large-scale data cluster, you should give significant consideration to
  developing a custom &crushmap;, because it will help you manage your &ceph;
  cluster, improve performance and ensure data safety.
 </para>
 <para>
  For example, if an OSD goes down, a &crushmap; can help you locate the
  physical data center, room, row and rack of the host with the failed OSD in
  the event you need to use on-site support or replace hardware.
 </para>
 <para>
  Similarly, CRUSH may help you identify faults more quickly. For example, if
  all OSDs in a particular rack go down simultaneously, the fault may lie with
  a network switch or power to the rack or the network switch rather than the
  OSDs themselves.
 </para>
 <para>
  A custom &crushmap;can also help you identify the physical locations where
  &ceph; stores redundant copies of data when the placement group(s) (refer to
  <xref linkend="op.pgs"/>) associated with a failed host are in a degraded
  state.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are three main sections to a &crushmap;.

  <para>
   To map placement groups to OSDs, a &crushmap; requires a list of OSD devices
   (the name of the OSD daemon). The list of devices appears first in the
   &crushmap;.

   As a general rule, an OSD daemon maps to a single disk.

  <tip>
   <para>
    You can remove these types and create your own bucket types.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   &ceph;’s deployment tools generate a &crushmap;that contains a bucket for
   each host, and a pool named 'default', which is useful for the default
   <literal>rbd</literal> pool. The remaining bucket types provide a means for
   storing information about the physical location of nodes/buckets, which
   makes cluster administration much easier when OSDs, hosts, or network
   hardware malfunction and the administrator needs access to physical
   hardware.
  </para>

  <para>
   A bucket has a type, a unique name (string), a unique ID expressed as a
   negative integer, a weight relative to the total capacity/capability of its
   item(s), the bucket algorithm ( <literal>straw</literal> by default), and
   the hash (<literal>0</literal> by default, reflecting CRUSH Hash
   <literal>rjenkins1</literal>). A bucket may have one or more items. The
   items may consist of other buckets or OSDs. Items may have a weight that
   reflects the relative weight of the item.
  </para>

<screen>[bucket-type] [bucket-name] {
  id [a unique negative numeric ID]
  weight [the relative capacity/capability of the item(s)]
  alg [the bucket type: uniform | list | tree | straw ]
  hash [the hash type: 0 by default]
  item [item-name] weight [weight]
}</screen>

  <para>
   The following example illustrates how you can use buckets to aggregate a
   pool and physical locations like a data center, a room, a rack and a row.

  <title>Rule Sets</title>

  <para>
   CRUSH maps support the notion of 'CRUSH rules', which are the rules that
   determine data placement for a pool. For large clusters, you will likely
   create many pools where each pool may have its own CRUSH ruleset and rules.
   The default &crushmap; has a rule for each pool, and one ruleset assigned to
   each of the default pools.
  </para>

  <title>Placement Groups</title>

  <para>
   &ceph; maps objects to placement groups (PGs). Placement groups are shards
   or fragments of a logical object pool that place objects as a group into
   OSDs. Placement groups reduce the amount of per-object metadata when &ceph;
   stores the data in OSDs. A larger number of placement groups (e.g., 100 per
   OSD) leads to better balancing.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="op.pgs.usage">
   <title>How Are Placement Groups Used ?</title>
   <para>
    A placement group (PG) aggregates objects within a pool. The main reason is
    that tracking object placement and metadata on a per-object basis is
    computationally expensive. For example, a system with millions of objects
    cannot track placement of its each object directly.
   </para>

   <para>
    The &ceph; client will calculate to which placement group an object will
    belong to. It does this by hashing the object ID and applying an operation
    based on the number of PGs in the defined pool and the ID of the pool.
   </para>
   <para>
    The object’s contents within a placement group are stored in a set of
    OSDs. For instance, in a replicated pool of size two, each placement group
    will store objects on two OSDs:

   <para>
    If OSD #2 fails, another OSD will be assigned to placement group #1 and
    will be filled with copies of all objects in OSD #1. If the pool size is
    changed from two to three, an additional OSD will be assigned to the
    placement group and will receive copies of all objects in the placement
    group.
   </para>
   <para>
    Placement groups do not own the OSD, they share it with other placement
    groups from the same pool or even other pools. If OSD #2 fails, the
    placement group #2 will also have to restore copies of objects, using OSD
    #3.
   </para>
   <para>
    When the number of placement groups increases, the new placement groups
    will be assigned OSDs. The result of the CRUSH function will also change
    and some objects from the former placement groups will be copied over to
    the new placement groups and removed from the old ones.

   <sect3 xml:id="op.pgs.choosing">
    <title>Number of Placement Groups for More than 50 OSDs</title>
    <para>
     If you have less than 50 OSDs, use the preselection described in
     <xref linkend="op.pgs.pg_num"/>. If you have more than 50 OSDs, we
     recommend approximately 50-100 placement groups per OSD to balance out
     resource usage, data durability and distribution. For a single pool of
     objects, you can use the following formula to get a baseline:
    </para>
<screen>
          total PGs = (OSDs * 100) / <replaceable>POOL_SIZE</replaceable>
</screen>
    <para>
     Where <replaceable>POOL_SIZE</replaceable> is either the number of
     replicas for replicated pools, or the 'k'+',m' sum for erasure code pools
     as returned by the <command>ceph osd erasure-code-profile get</command>
     command. You should rounded the result up to the nearest power of 2.
     Rounding up is recommended for the CRUSH algorithm to evenly balance the
     number of objects among placement groups.
    </para>
    <para>
     As an example, for a cluster with 200 OSDs and a pool size of 3 replicas,
     you would estimate the number of PGs as follows:
    </para>
<screen>
          (200 * 100) / 3 = 6667
</screen>
    <para>
     The nearest power of 2 is <emphasis role="bold">8192</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
     When using multiple data pools for storing objects, you need to ensure
     that you balance the number of placement groups per pool with the number
     of placement groups per OSD. You need to reach a reasonable total number
     of placement groups that provides reasonably low variance per OSD without
     taxing system resources or making the peering process too slow.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example a cluster of 10 pools each with 512 placement groups on 10
     OSDs is a total of 5,120 placement groups spread over 10 OSDs, that is 512
     placement groups per OSD. Such setup does not use too many resources.
     However, if 1000 pools were created with 512 placement groups each, the
     OSDs will handle approximately 50,000 placement groups each and it would
     require significantly more resources and time for peering.

    To set the number of placement groups in a pool, you need to specify the

    After you increase the number of placement groups, you also need to
    increase the number of placement groups for placement
    (<option>pgp_num</option>) before your cluster will rebalance. The

   <title>Prioritize Backfill and Recovery of Placement Groups</title>
   <para>
    You may run into a situation where several placement groups require

    others. For example, those PGs may hold data for images used by running
    machines and other PGs may be used by inactive machines or less relevant
    data. In that case, you may want to prioritize recovery of those groups so
    that performance and availability of data stored on those groups is
    restored earlier. To mark particular placement groups as prioritized during

   </para>
<screen>

&prompt.root;ceph pg force-backfill <replaceable>PG_ID1</replaceable> [<replaceable>PG_ID2</replaceable> ... ]
</screen>
   <para>
    This will cause &ceph; to perform recovery or backfill on specified
    placement groups first, before other placement groups. This does not
    interrupt currently ongoing backfills or recovery, but causes specified PGs
    to be processed as soon as possible. If you change your mind or prioritize
    wrong groups, cancel the prioritization:
   </para>
<screen>

  <title>Mixed SSDs and HDDs on the Same Node</title>

  <para>
   It can be desirable to configure a &ceph; cluster such that each node has a
   mix of SSDs and HDDs, with one storage pool on the fast SSDs and one storage
   pool on the slower HDDs. To do this, the &crushmap; needs to be edited.
  </para>

  <para>
   The default &crushmap; will have a simple hierarchy, where the default root
   contains hosts, and the hosts contain OSDs, for example:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph osd tree
 ID CLASS WEIGHT   TYPE NAME      STATUS REWEIGHT PRI-AFF
 -1       83.17899 root default
 -4       23.86200     host cpach

 8   hdd  1.81898         osd.8      up  1.00000 1.00000

 9   ssd  0.93100         osd.9      up  1.00000 1.00000 </screen>

  <para>
   This provides no distinction between disk types. In order to split the OSDs
   into SSDs and HDDs, we need to create a second hierarchy in the &crushmap;:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph osd crush add-bucket ssd root</screen>

  <para>
   Having created the new root for SSDs, we need to add hosts to it. This means
   creating new host entries. But because the same host name cannot appear more
   than once in a &crushmap;, this uses fake host names. These fake host names
   do not need to be resolvable by DNS. CRUSH does not care what the host names
   are, they only need to create the right hierarchies. The one thing that
   <emphasis>does</emphasis> need to be changed in order to support fake host
   names is that you must set
  </para>

<screen>osd crush update on start = false</screen>

  <para>
   in the
   <filename>/srv/salt/ceph/configuration/files/ceph.conf.d/global.conf</filename>
   file, and then run &deepsea; Stage 3 to distribute the change (refer to
   <xref
    linkend="ds.custom.cephconf"/> for more information):
  </para>

<screen>
&prompt.smaster;salt-run state.orch ceph.stage.3
</screen>

  <para>
   Otherwise the OSDs you move will be reset later to their original location
   in the default root, and the cluster will not behave as expected.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once that setting is changed, add the new fake hosts to the SSD root:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph osd crush add-bucket node1-ssd host
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush move node1-ssd root=ssd
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush add-bucket node2-ssd host
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush move node2-ssd root=ssd
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush add-bucket node3-ssd host
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush move node3-ssd root=ssd</screen>

  <para>
   Finally, for each SSD OSD, move the OSD to the SSD root. In this example, we
   assume that osd.0, osd.1 and osd.2 are physically hosted on SSDs:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph osd crush add osd.0 1 root=ssd
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush set osd.0 1 root=ssd host=node1-ssd
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush add osd.1 1 root=ssd
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush set osd.1 1 root=ssd host=node2-ssd
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush add osd.2 1 root=ssd
&prompt.root;ceph osd crush set osd.2 1 root=ssd host=node3-ssd</screen>

  <para>
   The CRUSH hierarchy should now look like this:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph osd tree

  <para>
   Now, create a CRUSH rule that targets the SSD root:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph osd crush rule create-simple ssd_replicated_ruleset ssd host</screen>

  <para>
   The original default <option>replicated_ruleset</option> (with ID 0) will
   target the HDDs. The new <option>ssd_replicated_ruleset</option> (with ID 1)
   will target the SSDs.
  </para>

  <para>
   Any existing pools will still be using the HDDs, because they are in the
   default hierarchy in the &crushmap;. A new pool can be created to use SSDs
   only:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ceph osd pool create ssd-pool 64 64
&prompt.root;ceph osd pool set ssd-pool crush_rule ssd_replicated_ruleset</screen>
