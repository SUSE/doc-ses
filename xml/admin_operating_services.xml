 <title>Operating &ceph; Services</title>
 <para>
  &ceph; related services are operated with the <command>systemctl</command>
  command. The operation takes place on the node you are currently logged in
  to. You need to have &rootuser; privileges to be able to operate on &ceph;
  services.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="ceph.operating.services.targets">
  <title>Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Services using Targets</title>

  <para>
   To facilitate starting, stopping, and restarting all the services of a
   particular type (for example all &ceph; services, or all MONs, or all OSDs)
   on a node, &ceph; provides the following &systemd; unit files:
  </para>

<screen>ceph.target
ceph-osd.target
ceph-mon.target
ceph-mds.target
ceph-radosgw.target
ceph-rbd-mirror.target</screen>

  <para>
   To start/stop/restart all &ceph; services on the node, run:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl stop ceph.target
systemctl start ceph.target
systemctl restart ceph.target</screen>

  <para>
   To start/stop/restart all OSDs on the node, run:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl stop ceph-osd.target
systemctl start ceph-osd.target
systemctl restart ceph-osd.target</screen>

  <para>
   Commands for the other targets are analogous.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="ceph.operating.services.individual">
  <title>Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Individual Services</title>

  <para>
   You can operate individual services using the following parametrized
   &systemd; unit files:
  </para>

<screen>ceph-osd@.service
ceph-mon@.service
ceph-mds@.service
ceph-radosgw@.service
ceph-rbd-mirror@.service</screen>

  <para>
   To use these commands, you first need to identify the name of the service
   you want to operate. See
   <xref linkend="ceph.operating.services.finding_names"/> to learn more about
   services identification.
  </para>

  <para>
   To start/stop/restart the <literal>osd.1</literal> service, run:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl stop ceph-osd@1.service
systemctl start ceph-osd@1.service
systemctl restart ceph-osd@1.service</screen>

  <para>
   Commands for the other service types are analogous.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="ceph.operating.services.finding_names">
  <title>Identifying Individual Services</title>

  <para>
   You can find out the names/numbers of a particular type of service by
   running <command>systemctl</command> and filtering the results with the
   <command>grep</command> command. For example:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl | grep -i 'ceph-osd.*service'
systemctl | grep -i 'ceph-mon.*service'
[...]</screen>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="ceph.operating.services.status">
  <title>Service Status</title>

  <para>
   You can query &systemd; for the status of services. For example:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl status ceph-osd@1.service
systemctl status ceph-mon@vanguard2.service</screen>

  <para>
   If you do not know the exact name/number of the service, see
   <xref linkend="ceph.operating.services.finding_names"/>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
