  If you come across a problem when running SUSE Enterprise Storage 7
  related to some of its components, such as Ceph or Object Gateway, report the
  problem to SUSE Technical Support. The recommended way is with the
  <command>supportconfig</command> utility.
 </para>
 <tip>
  <para>
   Because <command>supportconfig</command> is modular software, make sure that
   the <systemitem>supportutils-plugin-ses</systemitem> package is installed.
  </para>
<screen><prompt>tux &gt; </prompt>rpm -q supportutils-plugin-ses</screen>
  <para>
   If it is missing on the Ceph server, install it with:
  </para>
<screen><prompt role="root">root # </prompt>zypper ref &amp;&amp; zypper in supportutils-plugin-ses</screen>
  <para>
   <literal>supportutils-plugin-ses</literal> will try to capture as much
   useful information as it can about both the Ceph cluster as a whole, and
   about the host on which it is running. Some information, including the
   Ceph daemon's status, <command>podman</command> image information,
   <command>rpm</command> verification and some relevant configuration data
   will be saved to the <filename>plugin-ses.txt</filename> file inside the
   <filename>supportconfig</filename> <command>tar</command> archive. A lot
   more information, including overall cluster status, logs, and diagnostic
   data for each currently running Ceph daemon will be saved to files in the
   Ceph subdirectory inside the supportconfig tar archive.
  </para>
 </tip>
 <para>
  When <command>supportconfig</command> is run on an Admin Node, it will be able to
  capture the overall status of the entire cluster. For example, <command>ceph
  status</command> and <command>ceph health</command>. If the
  <filename>ceph.conf</filename> file and admin keyring are not present, it
  will not be able to capture overall cluster status, but still capture
  diagnostic data for each currently running Ceph daemon.
 </para>
 <para>
  In general, when using <command>supportconfig</command>, you will want to run
  it on an admin node (to ensure the overall cluster status is captured), as
  well as on any other nodes that are experiencing problems, to ensure it
  captures diagnostic data for anything and everything that may be relevant.
 </para>
 <para>
  Although you can use <command>supportconfig</command> on the command line, we
  recommend using the related YaST module. Find more information about
  <command>supportconfig</command> in
