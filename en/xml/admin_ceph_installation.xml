  This chapter outlines procedures to deploy the &ceph; cluster. Currently
  we support the following methods of deployment:

  <title>Deploying with <command>ceph-deploy</command></title>

  <para>
   <command>ceph-deploy</command> is a command line utility to ease the way
   you deploy &ceph; cluster in your small scale setups.

    For testing purposes, a minimal &ceph; cluster can be made to run on a
    single node. However, in a production setup we recommend using at least
    four nodes: one admin node and three cluster nodes, each running one
    monitor daemon and some number of object storage daemons (OSDs).

    <para>
     Although &ceph; nodes can be virtual machines, real hardware is
     strongly recommended for the production environment.
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="ceph.install.ceph-deploy.network">
   <title>Network Recommendations</title>
   <para>
    The network environment where you intend to run &ceph; should be split
    into a public part and trusted internal part. While the public part
    serves for providing the service to the customers, the internal part
    provides for the authenticated &ceph; network communication.
   </para>
   <para>
    The main reason is that although &ceph; authentication and protection
    against attacks once secret keys are in place, the messages used to
    configure these keys may be transferred open and are vulnerable.
   </para>
   <tip>
    <title>Nodes Configured via DHCP</title>
    <para>
     If your storage nodes are configured via DHCP, the default timeouts may
     not be sufficient for the network to be configured correctly before the
     various &ceph; daemons start. If this happens, the &ceph; MONs and OSDs
     will not start correctly (running <command>systemctl status
     ceph\*</command> will result in "unable to bind" errors), and Calamari
     may be unable to display graphs. To avoid this issue, we recommend
     increasing the DHCP client timeout to at least 30 seconds on each node
     in your storage cluster. This can be done by changing the following
     settings on each node:
    </para>
    <para>
     In <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp</filename> set
    </para>

    Before deploying the &ceph; cluster, apply the following steps for each
    &ceph; node as &rootuser;:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Install &sle; 12 SP1 and add the &storage; extension. It provides a
      software repository with the software needed to run &ceph;.
      For more information on the extension installation, see 
      <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/cha_add-ons.html"/>.

      Check the firewall status
     </para>
<screen>sudo /sbin/SuSEfirewall2 status</screen>
     <para>
      and if it is on, either turn it off with
     </para>

      <xref linkend="storage.bp.net.firewall"/>.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Make sure that network settings are correct: each &ceph; node needs to
      route to all other &ceph; nodes, and each &ceph; node needs to resolve
      all other &ceph; nodes by their short host names (without the domain
      suffix). If these two conditions are not met, &ceph; fails.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Install and set up NTP&mdash;the time synchronization tool. We
      strongly recommend using NTP within the &ceph; cluster. The reason is
      that &ceph; daemons pass critical messages to each other, which must
      be processed before daemons reach a timeout threshold. If the clocks
      in &ceph; monitors are not synchronized, it can lead to a number of
      anomalies, such as daemons ignoring received messages.
     </para>
     <para>
      Even though clock drift may still be noticeable with NTP, it is not
      yet harmful.
     </para>
     <para>
      To install NTP, run the following:
     </para>
<screen>sudo zypper in ntp yast2-ntp-client</screen>

      To configure NTP, go to <menuchoice><guimenu>&yast;</guimenu>

     <para>
      Install SSH server. &ceph; uses SSH to log in to all cluster nodes.
      Make sure SSH is installed (<command>zypper in openssh</command>) and

    <para>
     Now open your Web browser and point it to the host name/IP address of
     the server where you installed Calamari. Log in with the credentials
     you entered when installing the Calamari client. A welcome screen
     appears, instructing you to enter the <command>ceph-deploy calamari
     connect</command> command. Switch to the terminal on the Calamari host
     and enter the following command. Note that the
     <option>--master</option> option specifies the hostname of the Calamari
     server to which all the cluster nodes connect to:
    </para>
<screen>ceph-deploy calamari --master <replaceable>master_host</replaceable> connect <replaceable>node1</replaceable> <replaceable>node2</replaceable> <replaceable>...</replaceable></screen>
    <para>
     After the command is successfully finished, reload the Web browser. Now
     you can monitor your &ceph; cluster, OSDs, pools, etc.
    </para>
    <important>
     <para>
      The Calamari dashboard screen shows the current status of the cluster.
      This updates regularly, so any change to the cluster state&mdash;for
      example if a node goes offline&mdash;should be reflected in Calamari
      within a few seconds. The <guimenu>Health</guimenu> panel includes a
      timer to indicate how long it has been since Calamari last saw
      heartbeat information from the cluster. Normally, this will not be
      more than one minute old, but in certain failure cases, for instance
      when a network outage occurs or if the cluster loses quorum (that is
      if more than half of the monitor nodes are down), Calamari will no
      longer be able to determine cluster state. In this case, the
      <guimenu>Health</guimenu> panel will indicate that the last update was
      more than one minute ago. After too long time with no updates,
      Calamari displays a warning at the top of the screen "Cluster Updates
      Are Stale. The Cluster is not updating Calamari." If this occurs, the
      other status information Calamari presents will not be correct so you
      should investigate further to check the status of your storage nodes
      and network.
     </para>
    </important>
    <tip>
     <para>
      They may be leftovers of the previous Calamari setup on the system. If
      after logging in to the Calamari application some nodes are already
      joined or registered, run the following on the Calamari host to
      trigger a re-run of salt on all &ceph; nodes, which should clear up
      any odd state or missing bits and pieces.
     </para>
<screen>salt '*' state.highstate</screen>
     <para>
      We also recommend to remove files from the previous Calamari setup,
      such as state files, configuration files, or PostgreSQL database
      files. At minimum, remove the files in the following directories:
